consistent system of accentuation for Elvish names. My father wrote, for instance; <I>Palûrien, Palúrien, Palurien; Ónen, Onen; Kôr, Kor</I>. I have used the acute accent for macron, circumflex, and acute (and occasional grave) accents of the original texts, but the circumflex on monosyllables — thus <I>Palúrien, Ónen, Kôr</I>: the same system, at least to the eye, as in later Sindarin.

Lastly, the division of this edition into two parts is entirely due to the length of the <I>Tales</I>. The edition is conceived as a whole, and I hope that the second part will appear within a year of the first; but each part has its own Index and Appendix on Names. The second part contains what are in many respects the most interesting of the <I>Tales: Tinúviel, Turambar</I> (Turin), <I>The Fall of Gondolin</I>, and the <I>Tale of the Nauglaf-ring</I> (the Necklace of the Dwarves); outlines for the <I>Tale of Earendel</I> and the conclusion of the work; and <I>Ǽlfwine of England</I>.
