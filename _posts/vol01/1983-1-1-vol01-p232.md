232      THE BOOK OF LOST TALES: PART I
</p>

With the morning fish — 'twas his regal wish —

They packed him to Norwich town,<BR>To get warm on gin in a Norfolk inn,

And dry his watery gown. 60<BR>Though Saint Peter's knell waked many a bell

In the city's ringing towers<BR>To shout the news of his lunatic cruise

In the early morning hours, 64

No hearths were laid, not a breakfast made,

And no one would sell him gems;<BR>He found ashes for fire, and his gay desire

For chorus and brave anthems 68<BR>Met snores instead with all Norfolk abed,

And his round heart nearly broke,<BR>More empty and cold than above of old,

Till he bartered his fairy cloak 72

With a half-waked cook for a kitchen nook,

And his belt of gold for a smile,<BR>And a priceless jewel for a bowl of gruel,

A sample cold and vile 76<BR>Of the proud plum-porridge of Anglian Norwich —

He arrived so much too soon<BR>For unusual guests on adventurous quests

From the Mountains of the Moon. 80

It seems very possible that the ‘pallid minaret’ reappears in the ‘little white turret’ which Uolë Kúvion built on the Moon, ‘where often he climbs and watches the heavens, or the world beneath’. The minaret of the Man in the Moon survives in the final version.

The ocean of Almain is the North Sea <I>(Almain </I>or <I>Almany </I>was a name of Germany in earlier English); the Yare is a Norfolk river which falls into the sea at Yarmouth, and the Nene (pronounced also with a short vowel) flows into the Wash.
