Commentary on <I>The Coming of the Elves and the Making of Kôr</I>

I have already ([p. 119]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p119)) touched on the great difference in the structure of the narrative at the beginning of this tale, namely that here the Elves awoke <I>during</I> Melko's captivity in Valinor, whereas in the later story it was the very fact of the Awakening that brought the Valar to make war on Melkor, which led to his imprisonment in Mandos. Thus the ultimately very important matter of the capture of the Elves about Cuiviénen by Melkor <I>(The Silmarillion</I> pp. 49-50) is necessarily entirely absent. The release of Melko from Mandos here takes place far earlier, before the coming of the Elvish ‘ambassadors' to Valinor, and Melko plays a part in the debate concerning the summons.

The story of Oromë's coming upon the newly-awakened Elves is seen to go back to the beginnings (though here Yavanna Palúrien was also present, as it appears), but its singular beauty and force is the less for the fact of their coming being known independently to Manwë, so that the great Valar did not need to be told of it by Oromë. The name <I>Eldar</I> was already in existence in Valinor before the Awakening, and the story of its being given by Oromë (‘the People of the Stars') had not arisen — as will be seen from the Appendix on Names, <I>Eldar</I> had a quite different etymology at this time. The later distinction between the <I>Eldar</I> who followed Oromë on the westward journey to the ocean and the <I>Avari</I>, the Unwilling, who would not heed the summons of the Valar, is not present, and indeed in this tale there is no suggestion that any Elves who heard the summons refused it; there were however, according to another (later) tale, Elves who never left Palisor (pp. [262]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p262), [266]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p266)).

Here it is Nornorë, Herald of the Gods, not Oromë, who brought the three Elves to Valinor and afterwards returned them to the Waters of Awakening (and it is notable that even in this earliest version, given more than the later to ‘explanations', there is no hint of how they passed from the distant
