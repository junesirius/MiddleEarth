<p style="text-indent: 0;">
Then the wide-umbraged elms began to fail;<BR>Their mourning multitude of leaves grew pale,
</p>

Seeing afar the icy spears<BR>80     Of Winter marching blue behind the sun

Of bright All-Hallows. Then their hour was done,<BR>And wanly borne on wings of amber pale<BR>They beat the wide airs of the fading vale,<BR>And flew like birds across the misty meres.

III

85     This is the season dearest to the heart,

And time most fitting to the ancient town,<BR>With waning musics sweet that slow depart

Winding with echoed sadness faintly down<BR>The paths of stranded mist. O gentle time,<BR>90     When the late mornings are begemmed with rime,

And early shadows fold the distant woods!<BR>The Elves go silent by, their shining hair

They cloak in twilight under secret hoods<BR>Of grey, and filmy purple, and long bands<BR>95      Of frosted starlight sewn by silver hands.

And oft they dance beneath the roofless sky,

When naked elms entwine in branching lace<BR>The Seven Stars, and through the boughs the eye

Stares golden-beaming in the round moon's face.<BR>100     O holy Elves and fair immortal Folk,

You sing then ancient songs that once awoke

Under primeval stars before the Dawn;<BR>You whirl then dancing with the eddying wind,

As once you danced upon the shimmering lawn<BR>105     In Elvenhome, before we were, before

You crossed wide seas unto this mortal shore.<BR>Now are thy trees, old Grey Kortirion,<BR>Through pallid mists seen rising tall and wan,<BR>Like vessels floating vague, and drifting far<BR>110     Down opal seas beyond the shadowy bar

Of cloudy ports forlorn;<BR>Leaving behind for ever havens loud,<BR>Wherein their crews a while held feasting proud<BR>And lordly ease, they now like windy ghosts
