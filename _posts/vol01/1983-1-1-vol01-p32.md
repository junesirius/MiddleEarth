<SUB>77</SUB> Then the wide-umbraged elms began to fail;

<SUB>78</SUB> Their mourning multitude of leaves grew pale,

<SUB>79</SUB> Seeing afar the icy spears

<SUB>80</SUB> Of Winter marching blue behind the sun

<SUB>81</SUB> Of bright All-Hallows. Then their hour was done,

<SUB>82</SUB> And wanly borne on wings of amber pale

<SUB>83</SUB> They beat the wide airs of the fading vale,

<SUB>84</SUB> And flew like birds across the misty meres.

<BR>

<I>III</I>

<SUB>85</SUB> This is the season dearest to the heart,

<SUB>86</SUB> And time most fitting to the ancient town,

<SUB>87</SUB> With waning musics sweet that slow depart

<SUB>88</SUB> Winding with echoed sadness faintly down

<SUB>89</SUB> The paths of stranded mist. O gentle time,

<SUB>90</SUB> When the late mornings are begemmed with rime,

<SUB>91</SUB> And early shadows fold the distant woods!

<SUB>92</SUB> The Elves go silent by, their shining hair

<SUB>93</SUB> They cloak in twilight under secret hoods

<SUB>94</SUB> Of grey, and filmy purple, and long bands

<SUB>95</SUB> Of frosted starlight sewn by silver hands.

<SUB>96</SUB> And oft they dance beneath the roofless sky,

<SUB>97</SUB> When naked elms entwine in branching lace

<SUB>98</SUB> The Seven Stars, and through the boughs the eye

<SUB>99</SUB> Stares golden-beaming in the round moon's face.

<SUB>100</SUB> O holy Elves and fair immortal Folk,

<SUB>101</SUB> You sing then ancient songs that once awoke

<SUB>102</SUB> Under primeval stars before the Dawn;

<SUB>103</SUB> You whirl then dancing with the eddying wind,

<SUB>104</SUB> As once you danced upon the shimmering lawn

<SUB>105</SUB> In Elvenhome, before we were, before

<SUB>106</SUB> You crossed wide seas unto this mortal shore.

<SUB>107</SUB> Now are thy trees, old Grey Kortirion,

<SUB>108</SUB> Through pallid mists seen rising tall and wan,

<SUB>109</SUB> Like vessels floating vague, and drifting far

<SUB>110</SUB> Down opal seas beyond the shadowy bar

<SUB>111</SUB> Of cloudy ports forlorn;

<SUB>112</SUB> Leaving behind for ever havens loud,

<SUB>113</SUB> Wherein their crews a while held feasting proud

<SUB>114</SUB> And lordly ease, they now like windy ghosts
