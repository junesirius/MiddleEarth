in which a Man, Eriol, comes after a great voyage over the ocean to the island where the Elves dwell and learns their history from their own lips, had (by degrees) fallen away. When my father died in 1973 ‘The Silmarillion’ was in a characteristic state of disarray: the earlier parts much revised or largely rewritten, the concluding parts still as he had left them some twenty years before; but in the latest writing there is no trace or suggestion of any ‘device’ or ‘framework’ in which it was to be set. I think that in the end he concluded that nothing would serve, and no more would be said beyond an explanation of how (within the imagined world) it came to be recorded.

In the original edition of <I>The Lord of the Rings</I> Bilbo gave to Frodo at Rivendell as his parting gift ‘some books of lore that he had made at various times, written in his spidery hand, and labelled on their red backs: <I>Translations from the Elvish, by B.B.</I>’ In the second edition (1966) ‘some books’ was changed to ‘three books’, and in the <I>Note on the Shire Records</I> added to the Prologue in that edition my father said that the content of ‘the three large volumes bound in red leather’ was preserved in that copy of the Red Book of West-march which was made in Gondor by the King's Writer Findegil in the year 172 of the Fourth Age; and also that these three volumes were found to be a work of great skill and learning in which . . . [Bilbo] had used all the sources available to him in Rivendell, both living and written. But since they were little used by Frodo, being almost entirely concerned with the Elder Days, no more is said of them here.

In <I>The Complete Guide to Middle-earth</I> Robert Foster says: <I>‘Quenta Silmarillion</I> was no doubt one of Bilbo's <I>Translations from the Elvish</I> preserved in the Red Book of West-march.’ So also I have assumed: the ‘books of lore’ that Bilbo gave to Frodo provided in the end the solution: they were ‘The Silmarillion’. But apart from the evidence cited here, there is, so far as I know, no other statement on this matter anywhere in my father's writings; and (wrongly, as I think now) I was reluctant to step into the breach and make definite what I only surmised. The choice before me, in respect of ‘The Silmarillion’,
