There exist two small books, contemporary with the <I>Lost Tales,</I> which contain the first ‘lexicons' of the Elvish languages; and both of them are very difficult documents.

One is concerned with the language called, in the book, <I>Qenya,</I> and I shall refer to this book as 'QL' (Qenya Lexicon). A good proportion of the entries in the first half of the alphabet were made at one time, when the work was first begun; these were very carefully written, though the pencil is now faint. Among these original entries is this group:

<I>Lemin</I> ‘five’

<I>Lempe</I> ‘ten’<BR><I>Leminkainen</I> ‘23 ’

The choice of '23' suggests that this was my father's age at the time, and that the book was begun therefore in 1915. This is supported by some of the statements made in the first layer of entries about certain figures of the mythology, statements that are at odds with everything that is said elsewhere, and which give glimpses of a stage even earlier than the <I>Lost Tales.</I>

The book naturally continued in use, and many entries (virtually all of those in the second part of the alphabet) are later than this first layer, though nothing more definite can be said than that all entries belong to the period of (or not long preceding) the <I>Lost Tales.</I>

The words in QL are arranged according to ‘roots', and a note at the beginning states:
