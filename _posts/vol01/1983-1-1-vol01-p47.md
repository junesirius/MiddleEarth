themselves Eldar — for instance, ‘the Noldoli, who were the sages of the Eldar’ (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p56">p. 56</a>); but on the other hand we read that after the Flight of the Noldoli from Valinor Aulë ‘gave still his love to those few faithful Gnomes who remained still about his halls, yet did he name them thereafter “Eldar” ’ (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p196">p. 196</a>). This is not so purely contradictory as appears at first sight. It seems that (on the one hand) the opposition of ‘Eldar’ or ‘Elfin’ to ‘Gnomish’ arose because Gnomish had become a language apart; and while the Gnomes were certainly themselves Eldar, their language was not. But (on the other hand) the Gnomes had long ago left Kôr, and thus came to be seen as not ‘Koreldar’, and therefore not ‘Eldar’. The word <I>Eldar</I> had thus narrowed its meaning, but might at any moment be expanded again to the older sense in which the Noldoli were ‘Eldar’.
</p>

If this is so, the narrowed sense of <I>Eldar</I> reflects the situation in after days in Tol Eressëa; and indeed, in the tales that follow, where the narrative is concerned with the time before the rebellion of the Noldoli and their departure from Valinor, they are firmly ‘Eldar’. <I>After</I> the rebellion, in the passage cited above, Aulë would not call the Noldoli who remained in Valinor by that name — and, by implication, he would not call those who had departed ‘Eldar’.

The same ambiguity is present in the words <I>Elves</I> and <I>Elfin</I>. Rúmil here calls the language of the Eldar ‘Elfin’ in opposition to ‘Gnomish’; the teller of the <I>Tale of Tinúviel</I> says: ‘This is my tale, and 'tis a tale of the Gnomes, wherefore I beg that thou fill not Eriol's ear with thy Elfin names', and in the same passage ‘Elves' are specifically opposed to ‘Gnomes'. But, again, in the tales that follow in this book, <I>Elves</I> and <I>Eldar</I> and <I>Eldalië</I> are used interchangeably of the Three Kindreds (see for instance the account of the debate of the Valar concerning the summoning of the Elves to Valinor, [pp. 124-7]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p124)). And finally, an apparently similar variation is seen in the word ‘fairy’; thus Tol Eressëa is the name ‘in the fairy speech’, while ‘the Gnomes call it Dor Faidwen’ ([p. 1]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p1)), but on the other hand Gilfanon, a Gnome, is called ‘one of the oldest of the fairies' ([p. 195]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p195)).

It will be seen from Rúmil's remarks that the ‘deep sundering’ of the speech of the Elves into two branches was at this time given an historical basis wholly different from that
