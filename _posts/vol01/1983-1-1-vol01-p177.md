them concerning the coming of Men — and his expressed reluctance to have the Eldar return to ‘the world’ while Men were still in their infancy. No such idea is represented in <I>The Silmarillion</I> as being in Manwë's mind (nor is there any suggestion that Manwë's knowledge was so great); and indeed, where in the old story it was Manwë's very description of Men and account of his policy with regard to them that gave rise to Fëanor's rhetoric against them, and which gave strong colour to his assertion of the Valar's true motive for bringing the Eldar to Valinor, in <I>The Silmarillion</I> (p. 68) these ideas are a part of the lies of Melkor (I have noticed above that in Melko's persuasions of the Noldoli in the tale there is no reference to the coming of Men).

An otherwise unknown element in the Music of the Ainur is revealed in Manwë's words: that the world shall come in the end for a great while under the sway of Men. In the original version there are several suggestions in reflective asides that all was fated: so here ‘the jealousy of Elves and Men’ is seen as perhaps a necessary part of the unfolding of the history of the world, and earlier in the tale ([p. 156]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p156)) it is asked: ‘Who shall say but that all these deeds, even the seeming needless evil of Melko, were but a portion of the destiny of old?’

But for all the radical changes in the narrative the characteristic note of Fëanor's rhetoric remained; his speech to the Noldoli of Kôr rises in the same rhythms as his speech by torchlight to the Noldor of Tirion <I>(The Silmarillion</I> pp. 82-3).

In the story of Melko and Ungoliont it is seen that essential elements were present <I>ab initio:</I> the doubt as to her origin, her dwelling in the desolate regions in the south of the Outer Lands, her sucking in of light to bring forth webs of darkness; her alliance with Melko, his rewarding her with the gems stolen from the Noldoli (though this was differently treated later), the piercing of the Trees by Melko and Ungo-liont's sucking up the light; and the great hunt mounted by the Valar, which failed of its object through darkness and mist, allowing Melko to escape out of Valinor by the northward ways.

Within this structure there are as almost always a great many points of difference between the first story and the later
