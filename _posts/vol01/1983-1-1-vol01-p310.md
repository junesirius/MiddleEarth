<I>telu-</I> ‘to finish, end’, <I>telu</I> (noun), <I>telwa</I> ‘last, late’, with the suggestion that this was perhaps an extension of root TELE ‘cover in’ (see <I>Telimektar</I>). In GL these meanings ‘cover in — close — finish’ are expressly assigned to the root TEL-: <I>telm</I> ‘roof, sky’, <I>teloth</I> ‘roofing, canopy, shelter’, <I>telu-</I> ‘to close, end, finish’, <I>telu</I> ‘end’.
</p>

<B>Telimektar</B>   In QL <I>Telimektar, Telimbektar</I> is glossed ‘Orion, literally Swordsman of Heaven’, and is given under the root TELE ‘cover in’, together with <I>tel</I> ‘roof, <I>telda</I> ‘having a roof, <I>telimbo</I> ‘canopy; sky’, etc. <I>-mektar</I> probably derives from the root MAKA, see <I>Makar</I>. The Gnomish form is <I>Telumaithar</I>.

In the Valar name-list he is called also <I>Taimondo</I>. There are substantial notes on this name in both dictionaries, which appear to have been entered at the same time. In QL <I>Taimondo</I> and <I>Taimordo</I>, names of Telimektar, together with <I>Taimë, Taimië</I> ‘the sky’, were entered under the root TAHA (see <I>[Qalmë-Tárí]({{site.baseurl}}/characters#Qalmë-Tárí)</I>). The Gnomish equivalent is <I>Daimord (dai, daimoth</I> ‘sky, heaven’), who appears also in the GL entry concerning Inwë's son Ingil (Gil, Sirius): he rose into the heavens in the likeness of a great bee and ‘followed Daimord’ (see <I>[Ingil]({{site.baseurl}}/characters#Ingil)</I>). But the word <I>mordo</I> ‘warrior, hero’ in Qenya was actually a borrowing from Gnomish <I>mord</I>, and the true Qenya equivalent of <I>mord</I> was <I>mavar</I> ‘shepherd’ — this being the original meaning of the Gnomish word also, which developed that of ‘man, warrior’ through its use in poetry after it had become obsolete in prose and speech. Thus <I>Daimord</I> originally meant ‘Shepherd of the Sky’, as did the original Qenya name <I>Taimavar</I>, altered under the influence of the Gnomish name to <I>Taimondo, Taimordo</I>.

<B>Telimpë</B>  Not in QL under root TELPE, which has however <I>telempë=telpë</I> ‘silver’. Gnomish words are <I>celeb</I> ‘silver’, <I>celebrin</I> ‘of silver’, <I>Celebron, Celioth</I> names of the Moon. See <I>[Ilsaluntë]({{site.baseurl}}/characters#Ilsaluntë)</I>.

<B>Tevildo</B>   Given in QL under root TEFE (with derivatives <I>teve-</I> ‘to hate’, <I>tevin, tevië</I> ‘hatred’) and explained as
