I conclude this commentary with a note on my father's use of the word <I>Gnomes</I> for the <I>Noldor</I>, who in the <I>Lost Tales</I> are called <I>Noldoli</I>. He continued to use it for many years, and it still appeared in earlier editions of <I>The Hobbit. \*</I>

In a draft for the final paragraph of Appendix F to <I>The Lord of the Rings</I> he wrote:

I have sometimes (not in this book) used ‘Gnomes' <I>for Noldor</I> and ‘Gnomish’ for <I>Noldorin</I>. This I did, for whatever Paracelsus may have thought (if indeed he invented the name) to some ‘Gnome’ will still suggest knowledge.† Now the High-elven name of this people, Noldor, signifies Those who Know; for of the three kindreds of the Eldar from their beginning the Noldor were ever distinguished both by their knowledge of things that are and were in this world, and by their desire to know more. Yet they in no way resembled the Gnomes either of learned theory or popular fancy; and I have now abandoned this rendering as too misleading. For the Noldor belonged to a race high and beautiful, the elder Children of the world, who now are gone. Tall they were, fair-skinned and grey-eyed, and their locks were dark, save in the golden house of Finrod . . .

In the last paragraph of Appendix F <I>as published</I> the

<BR>
\* In Chapter 3, <I>A Short Rest</I>, ‘swords of the High Elves of the West’ replaced ‘swords of the elves that are now called Gnomes'; and in Chapter 8, <I>Flies and Spiders</I>, the phrase ‘There the Light-elves and the Deep-elves and the Sea-elves went and lived for ages' replaced There the Light-elves and the Deep-elves (or Gnomes) and the Sea-elves lived for ages'.

† Two words are in question: (1) Greek <I>gnome</I> ‘thought, intelligence’ (and in the plural ‘maxims, sayings', whence the English word <I>gnome</I>, a maxim or aphorism, and adjective <I>gnomic);</I> and (2) the word <I>gnome</I> used by the 16th-century writer Paracelsus as a synonym <I>of pygmaeus</I>. Paracelsus ‘says that the beings so called have the earth as their element . . . through which they move unobstructed as fish do through water, or birds and land animals through air’ <I>(Oxford English Dictionary</I> s.v. <I>Gnome<SUP>2</SUP>)</I>. The <I>O.E.D</I>. suggests that whether Paracelsus invented the word himself or not it was intended to mean ‘earth-dweller’, and discounts any connection with the other word <I>Gnome</I>. (This note is repeated from that in <I>The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien</I>, p. 449; see the letter (no. 239) to which it refers.)
