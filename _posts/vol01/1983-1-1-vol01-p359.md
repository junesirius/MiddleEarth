the development was seldom by outright rejection — far more often it was by subtle transformation in stages, so that the growth of the legends (the process, for instance, by which the Nargothrond story made contact with that of Beren and Lúthien, a contact not even hinted at in the <I>Lost Tales</I>, though both elements were present) can seem like the growth of legends among peoples, the product of many minds and generations.

<I>The Book of Lost Tales</I> was begun by my father in 1916-17 during the First War, when he was 25 years old, and left incomplete several years later. It is the starting-point, at least in fully-formed narrative, of the history of Valinor and Middle-earth; but before the <I>Tales</I> were complete he turned to the composition of long poems, the <I>Lay of Leithian</I> in rhyming couplets (the story of Beren and Lúthien), and <I>The Children of Húrin</I> in alliterative verse. The prose form of the ‘mythology’ began again from a new starting-point* in a quite brief synopsis, or ‘Sketch’ as he called it, written in 1926 and expressly intended to provide the necessary background of knowledge for the understanding of the alliterative poem. The further written development of the prose form proceeded from that ‘Sketch’ in a direct line to the version of ‘The Silmarillion’ which was nearing completion towards the end of 1937, when my father broke off to send it as it stood to Alien and Unwin in November of that year; but there were also important side-branches and subordinate texts composed in the 1930s, as the <I>Annals of Valinor</I> and the <I>Annals of Beleriand</I> (fragments of which are extant also in the Old English translations made by Ǽlfwine (Eriol)), the cosmo-logical account called <I>Ambarkanta</I>, the Shape of the World, by Rúmil, and the <I>Lhammas</I> or ‘Account of Tongues', by Pengolod of Gondolin. Thereafter the history of the First Age was laid aside for many years, until <I>The Lord of the Rings</I> was completed, but in the years preceding its actual publication my father returned to ‘The Silmarillion’ and associated works with great vigour.

* Only in the case of <I>The Music of the Ainur</I> was there a direct development, manuscript to manuscript, from <I>The Book of Lost Tales</I> to the later forms; for <I>The Music of the Ainur</I> became separated off and continued as an independent work.
