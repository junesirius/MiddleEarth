This index provides (in intention) complete page-references to all entries with the exception of <I>Eldar/Elves, Gods/Valar</I>, and <I>Valinor</I>, the entries include the rejected name-forms given in the Notes, but the Appendix on Names is not covered.

Occasionally references are given to pages where a person or place is not actually named, as ‘the door-ward’ p. 41 under <I>Rúmil</I>. References are given to mentions of Tales that will appear in Part II, but not to mentions of those in this book. The explanatory statements are kept very brief, and names defined in the Index to <I>The Silmarillion</I> are not as a rule explained here.
