<I>The Book of Lost Tales</I>, written between sixty and seventy years ago, was the first substantial work of imaginative literature by J. R. R. Tolkien, and the first emergence in narrative of the Valar, of the Children of Ilúvatar, Elves and Men, of the Dwarves and the Orcs, and of the lands in which their history is set, Valinor beyond the western ocean, and Middle-earth, the ‘Great Lands' between the seas of east and west. Some fifty-seven years after my father ceased to work on the <I>Lost Tales, The Silmarillion\*</I> profoundly transformed from its distant forerunner, was published; and six years have passed since then. This Foreword seems a suitable opportunity to remark on some aspects of both works.

<I>The Silmarillion</I> is commonly said to be a ‘difficult’ book, needing explanation and guidance on how to ‘approach’ it; and in this it is contrasted to <I>The Lord of the Rings</I>. In Chapter 7 of his book <I>The Road to Middle-earth</I> Professor T. A. Shippey accepts that this is so (<I>‘The Silmarillion</I> could never be anything but hard to read’, p. 201), and expounds his view of why it should be. A complex discussion is not treated justly when it is extracted, but in his view the reasons are essentially two (p. 185). In the first place, there is in <I>The Silmarillion</I> no ‘mediation’ of the kind provided by the hobbits (so, in <I>The Hobbit</I>, ‘Bilbo acts as the link between modern times and the archaic world of dwarves and dragons').
