<I>The Tale of the Sun and Moon </I>231
</p>

And all lustrous gems for new diadems,

Or to blazon his pale attire. 20<BR>He was lonely too with nothing to do

But to stare at the golden world,<BR>Or strain for the hum that would distantly come

As it gaily past him whirled; 24

And at plenilune in his argent moon

He had wearily longed for Fire —<BR>Not the limpid lights of wan selenites,

But a red terrestrial pyre 28<BR>With impurpurate glows of crimson and rose

And leaping orange tongue;<BR>For great seas of blues and the passionate hues

When a dancing dawn is young; 32

For the meadowy ways like chrysoprase

By winding Yare and Nen.<BR>How he longed for the mirth of the populous Earth

And the sanguine blood of men; 36<BR>And coveted song and laughter long

And viands hot and wine,<BR>Eating pearly cakes of light snowflakes

And drinking thin moonshine. 40

He twinkled his feet as he thought of the meat,

Of the punch and the peppery brew,<BR>Till he tripped unaware on his slanting stair,

And fell like meteors do; 44<BR>As the whickering sparks in splashing arcs

Of stars blown down like rain<BR>From his laddery path took a foaming bath

In the Ocean of Almain; 48

And began to think, lest he melt and stink,

What in the moon to do,<BR>When a Yarmouth boat found him far afloat,

To the mazement of the crew 52<BR>Caught in their net all shimmering wet

In a phosphorescent sheen<BR>Of bluey whites and opal lights

And delicate liquid green. 56
