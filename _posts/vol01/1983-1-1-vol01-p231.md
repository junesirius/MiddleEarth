<SUB>19</SUB> And all lustrous gems for new diadems,

<SUB>20</SUB> Or to blazon his pale attire.

<SUB>21</SUB> He was lonely too with nothing to do

<SUB>22</SUB> But to stare at the golden world,

<SUB>23</SUB> Or strain for the hum that would distantly come

<SUB>24</SUB> As it gaily past him whirled;

<SUB>25</SUB> And at plenilune in his argent moon

<SUB>26</SUB> He had wearily longed for Fire —

<SUB>27</SUB> Not the limpid lights of wan selenites,

<SUB>28</SUB> But a red terrestrial pyre

<SUB>29</SUB> With impurpurate glows of crimson and rose

<SUB>30</SUB> And leaping orange tongue;

<SUB>31</SUB> For great seas of blues and the passionate hues

<SUB>32</SUB> When a dancing dawn is young;

<SUB>33</SUB> For the meadowy ways like chrysoprase

<SUB>34</SUB> By winding Yare and Nen.

<SUB>35</SUB> How he longed for the mirth of the populous Earth

<SUB>36</SUB> And the sanguine blood of men;

<SUB>37</SUB> And coveted song and laughter long

<SUB>38</SUB> And viands hot and wine,

<SUB>39</SUB> Eating pearly cakes of light snowflakes

<SUB>40</SUB> And drinking thin moonshine.

<SUB>41</SUB> He twinkled his feet as he thought of the meat,

<SUB>42</SUB> Of the punch and the peppery brew,

<SUB>43</SUB> Till he tripped unaware on his slanting stair,

<SUB>44</SUB> And fell like meteors do;

<SUB>45</SUB> As the whickering sparks in splashing arcs

<SUB>46</SUB> Of stars blown down like rain

<SUB>47</SUB> From his laddery path took a foaming bath

<SUB>48</SUB> In the Ocean of Almain;

<SUB>49</SUB> And began to think, lest he melt and stink,

<SUB>50</SUB> What in the moon to do,

<SUB>51</SUB> When a Yarmouth boat found him far afloat,

<SUB>52</SUB> To the mazement of the crew

<SUB>53</SUB> Caught in their net all shimmering wet

<SUB>54</SUB> In a phosphorescent sheen

<SUB>55</SUB> Of bluey whites and opal lights

<SUB>56</SUB> And delicate liquid green.
