The rejected draft text of <I>The Hiding of Valinor</I> continues a little way beyond the end of Vairë's tale, thus:

Now after the telling of this tale no more was there of speaking for that night, but Lindo begged Ailios to consent to a tale-telling of ceremony to be held the next night or as soon as might be; but Ailios would not agree, pleading matters that he must needs journey to a distant village to settle. So was it that the tale-telling was fixed ere the candles of sleep were lit for a sevennight from that time — and that was the day of Turuhalmë<SUP>[1]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p278)</SUP> or the Logdrawing. “Twill be a fitting day,’ saith Lindo, ‘for the sports of the morning in the snow and the gathering of the logs from the woods and the songs and drinking of Turuhalmë will leave us of right mood to listen to old tales beside this fire. ’

As I have noticed earlier ([p. 229]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p229)), the original form of the <I>Tale of the Sun and Moon</I> and <I>The Hiding of Valinor</I> belonged to the phase before the entry of Gilfanon of Tavrobel, replacing Ailios.

Immediately following this rejected draft text, on the same manuscript page, the text in ink of the <I>Tale of Turambar</I> (Turin) begins, with these words:

When then Ailios had spoken his fill the time for the lighting of candles was at hand, and so came the first day of Turuhalmë to an end; but on the second night Ailios was not there, and being asked by Lindo one Eltas began a tale . . .
