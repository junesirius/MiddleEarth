This led even to the sward's edge, and coming thither said Littleheart pointing to that white house: ‘Behold the dwelling of Meril-i-Turinqi, and as I have no errand with so great a lady I will get me back again.’ Then Eriol went over the sunny lawn alone until he was nigh shoulder-high in the tall flowers that grew before the porches of the door; and as he drew near a sound of music came to him, and a fair lady amid many maidens stepped forth as it were to meet him.
