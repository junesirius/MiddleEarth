Then said a child among the company, a great drinker-in of both tales and poesies: ‘And would that he had never come there since, and would that I might have seen that land still gleaming new as Aulë left it.’ Now she had heard Rúmil tell his tale before and was much in thought of it, but to the most of the company it was new, even as it was to Eriol, and they sat amazed. Then said Eriol: ‘Very mighty and glorious are the Valar, and I would fain hear yet more of those oldest days, did I not see the glimmer of the Candles of Sleep that fare now hither’; but another child spoke from a cushion nigh Lindo's chair and said: ‘Nay, 'tis in the halls of Makar I would fain be, and get perchance a sword or knife to wear; yet in Valmar methinks 'twould be good to be a guest of Oromë’, and Lindo laughing said: “Twould be good indeed,’ and thereat he arose, and the tale-telling was over for that night.

NOTES

<BR>
Changes made to names in <I>The Coming of the Valar and the Building of Valinor</I>

<I>Ónen   < Ówen </I>(at the first occurrence only; subsequently <I>Ónen </I>is the name as first written).

<I>Eruman </I>and <I>Arvalin </I>The names of this region were originally written <I>Habbanan </I>and <I>Harmalin, </I>but were emended throughout the tale (except in two cases where <I>Habbanan </I>was overlooked) to <I>Eruman </I>(once <I>Erumáni, </I>p. 70) and <I>Arvalin. </I>(In the last three occurrences <I>Habbanan > Arvalin, </I>whereas in the earlier ones <I>Habbanan > Eruman; </I>but the difference is presumably without significance, since the names <I>Habbanan / Harmalin </I>and later <I>Eruman I Arvalin </I>were interchangeable.) In <I>The Cottage of Lost Play </I>the changes were <I>Harwalin > Harmalin > Arvalin </I>([p. 12](/MiddleEarth/vol01-p12)).

<I>Lomendánar   </I>< <I>Lome Danar.</I>

<I>Silindrin    < Telimpë (Silindrin) </I>(at the first occurrence only; subsequently <I>Silindrin </I>is the name as first written).

<I>Lindeloksë   < Lindelótë </I>(cf. [p. 12](/MiddleEarth/vol01-p12)).
