The Music <I>of the Ainur </I>59
</p>

this reason maybe, Melko and many of the Ainu out of good or evil mind would ever be for meddling with them, but seeing that flu had made the Eldar too alike in nature if not in stature to the Ainu their dealings have been chiefly with Men.

The conclusion of this passage seems to be the only place<BR>where the second text is in direct contradiction of the draft.

Commentary on<BR>The Music <I>of the Ainur</I>

A linking passage continues the text of <I>The Music of the Ainur </I>and leads into the story of <I>The Building of Valinor </I>without any break in the narrative; but I postpone this link until the next chapter. The actual written text is likewise
