<I>Narquelion*</I>

Alalminórë! Green heart of this Isle

Where linger yet the Faithful Companies!<BR>45     Still undespairing here they slowly file

Down lonely paths with solemn harmonies:<BR>The Fair, the first-born in an elder day,<BR>Immortal Elves, who singing on their way

Of bliss of old and grief, though men forget,<BR>50     Pass like a wind among the rustling trees,

A wave of bowing grass, and men forget<BR>Their voices calling from a time we do not know,<BR>Their gleaming hair like sunlight long ago.

A wind in the grass! The turning of the year.<BR>55        A shiver in the reeds beside the stream,<BR>A whisper in the trees — afar they hear,

Piercing the heart of summer's tangled dream,<BR>Chill music that a herald piper plays<BR>Foreseeing winter and the leafless days.<BR>60        The late flowers trembling on the ruined walls<BR>Already stoop to hear that elven-flute.<BR>Through the wood's sunny aisles and tree-propped

halls

Winding amid the green with clear cold note<BR>Like a thin strand of silver glass remote.

65     The high-tide ebbs, the year will soon be spent;<BR>And all your trees, Kortirion, lament.<BR>At morn the whetstone rang upon the blade,<BR>At eve the grass and golden flowers were laid<BR>To wither, and the meadows bare.

70     Now dimmed already comes the tardier dawn,<BR>Paler the sunlight fingers creep across the lawn.<BR>The days are passing. Gone like moths the nights<BR>When white wings fluttering danced like satellites

* With the name <I>Narquelion </I>(which appears also in the title in Elvish of the original poem, see p. 25) cf. <I>Narquelië </I>‘Sun-fading’, name of the tenth month in Quenya <I>(The Lord of the Rings, </I>Appendix D).
