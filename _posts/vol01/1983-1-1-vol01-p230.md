the earlier versions of the <I>Tale of the Sun and Moon</I> and <I>The Hiding of Valinor</I>, and is the teller of the <I>Tale of the Naug-lafring</I>.

The poem about the Man in the Moon exists in many texts, and was published at Leeds in 1923;\* long after and much changed it was included in <I>The Adventures of Tom Bombadil</I> (1962). I give it here in the earlier published form, which was only a little retouched from the earliest workings — where it has the title ‘Why the Man in the Moon came down too soon: an East Anglian phantasy’; in the first finished text the title is ‘A Faerie: Why the Man in the Moon came down too soon’, together with one in Old English: <I>Se Móncyning</I>.

<I>Why the Man in the Moon came down too soon</I>

<SUB>1</SUB> The Man in the Moon had silver shoon

<SUB>2</SUB> And his beard was of silver thread;

<SUB>3</SUB> He was girt with pale gold and inaureoled

<SUB>4</SUB> With gold about his head.

<SUB>5</SUB> Clad in silken robe in his great white globe

<SUB>6</SUB> He opened an ivory door

<SUB>7</SUB> With a crystal key, and in secrecy

<SUB>8</SUB> He stole o'er a shadowy floor;

<SUB>9</SUB> Down a filigree stair of spidery hair

<SUB>10</SUB> He slipped in gleaming haste,

<SUB>11</SUB> And laughing with glee to be merry and free

<SUB>12</SUB> He swiftly earthward raced.

<SUB>13</SUB> He was tired of his pearls and diamond twirls;

<SUB>14</SUB> Of his pallid minaret

<SUB>15</SUB> Dizzy and white at its lunar height

<SUB>16</SUB> In a world of silver set;

<SUB>17</SUB> And adventured this peril for ruby and beryl

<SUB>18</SUB> And emerald and sapphire,
