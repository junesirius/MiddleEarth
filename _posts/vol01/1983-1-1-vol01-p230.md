230     THE BOOK OF LOST TALES: PART I
</p>

the earlier versions of the <I>Tale of the Sun and Moon </I>and <I>The Hiding of Valinor, </I>and is the teller of the <I>Tale of the Naug-lafring.</I>

The poem about the Man in the Moon exists in many texts, and was published at Leeds in 1923;* long after and much changed it was included in <I>The Adventures of Tom Bombadil </I>(1962). I give it here in the earlier published form, which was only a little retouched from the earliest workings — where it has the title ‘Why the Man in the Moon came down too soon: an East Anglian phantasy’; in the first finished text the title is ‘A Faerie: Why the Man in the Moon came down too soon’, together with one in Old English: <I>Se Móncyning.</I>

Why the Man in the Moon<BR>came down too soon

The Man in the Moon had silver shoon

And his beard was of silver thread;<BR>He was girt with pale gold and inaureoled

With gold about his head. 4<BR>Clad in silken robe in his great white globe

He opened an ivory door<BR>With a crystal key, and in secrecy

He stole o'er a shadowy floor; 8

Down a filigree stair of spidery hair

He slipped in gleaming haste,<BR>And laughing with glee to be merry and free

He swiftly earthward raced. 12<BR>He was tired of his pearls and diamond twirls;

Of his pallid minaret<BR>Dizzy and white at its lunar height

In a world of silver set; 16

And adventured this peril for ruby and beryl<BR>And emerald and sapphire,

* <I>‘A Northern Venture: </I>verses by members of the Leeds University English School Association’ (Leeds, at the Swan Press, 1923). I have not seen this publication and take these details from Humphrey Carpenter, <I>Biography, </I>p. 269.
