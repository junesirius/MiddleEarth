<SUB>41</SUB> A fleet of galleons that proudly slips

<SUB>42</SUB> Across long sunlit seas.

<BR>

<I>II</I>

<SUB>43</SUB> Thou art the inmost province of the fading isle,

<SUB>44</SUB> Where linger yet the Lonely Companies;

<SUB>45</SUB> Still, undespairing, here they slowly file

<SUB>46</SUB> Along thy paths with solemn harmonies:

<SUB>47</SUB> The holy people of an elder day,

<SUB>48</SUB> Immortal Elves, that singing fair and fey

<SUB>49</SUB> Of vanished things that were, and could be yet,

<SUB>50</SUB> Pass like a wind among the rustling trees,

<SUB>51</SUB> A wave of bowing grass, and we forget

<SUB>52</SUB> Their tender voices like wind-shaken bells

<SUB>53</SUB> Of flowers, their gleaming hair like golden asphodels.

<SUB>54</SUB> Once Spring was here with joy, and all was fair

<SUB>55</SUB> Among the trees; but Summer drowsing by the stream

<SUB>56</SUB> Heard trembling in her heart the secret player

<SUB>57</SUB> Pipe, out beyond the tangle of her forest dream,

<SUB>58</SUB> The long-drawn tune that elvish voices made

<SUB>59</SUB> Foreseeing Winter through the leafy glade;

<SUB>60</SUB> The late flowers nodding on the ruined walls

<SUB>61</SUB> Then stooping heard afar that haunting flute

<SUB>62</SUB> Beyond the sunny aisles and tree-propped halls;

<SUB>63</SUB> For thin and clear and cold the note,

<SUB>64</SUB> As strand of silver glass remote.

<SUB>65</SUB> Then all thy trees, Kortirion, were bent,

<SUB>66</SUB> And shook with sudden whispering lament:

<SUB>67</SUB> For passing were the days, and doomed the nights

<SUB>68</SUB> When flitting ghost-moths danced as satellites

<SUB>69</SUB> Round tapers in the moveless air;

<SUB>70</SUB> And doomed already were the radiant dawns,

<SUB>71</SUB> The fingered sunlight drawn across the lawns;

<SUB>72</SUB> The odour and the slumbrous noise of meads,

<SUB>73</SUB> Where all the sorrel, flowers, and plumed weeds

<SUB>74</SUB> Go down before the scyther's share.

<SUB>75</SUB> When cool October robed her dewy furze

<SUB>76</SUB> In netted sheen of gold-shot gossamers,
