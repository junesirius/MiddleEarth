<I>The Cottage of Lost Play </I>31
</p>

A fleet of galleons that proudly slips<BR>Across long sunlit seas.

II

Thou art the inmost province of the fading isle,

Where linger yet the Lonely Companies;<BR>45      Still, undespairing, here they slowly file

Along thy paths with solemn harmonies:<BR>The holy people of an elder day,<BR>Immortal Elves, that singing fair and fey

Of vanished things that were, and could be yet,<BR>50     Pass like a wind among the rustling trees,<BR>A wave of bowing grass, and we forget<BR>Their tender voices like wind-shaken bells<BR>Of flowers, their gleaming hair like golden aspho- <BR>dels.

Once Spring was here with joy, and all was fair<BR>55        Among the trees; but Summer drowsing by the

stream<BR>Heard trembling in her heart the secret player

Pipe, out beyond the tangle of her forest dream,<BR>The long-drawn tune that elvish voices made<BR>Foreseeing Winter through the leafy glade;<BR>60        The late flowers nodding on the ruined walls<BR>Then stooping heard afar that haunting flute

Beyond the sunny aisles and tree-propped halls;<BR>For thin and clear and cold the note,<BR>As strand of silver glass remote.<BR>65     Then all thy trees, Kortirion, were bent,

And shook with sudden whispering lament:

For passing were the days, and doomed the nights

When flitting ghost-moths danced as satellites

Round tapers in the moveless air;<BR>70     And doomed already were the radiant dawns,<BR>The fingered sunlight drawn across the lawns;<BR>The odour and the slumbrous noise of meads,<BR>Where all the sorrel, flowers, and plumed weeds

Go down before the scyther's share.<BR>75     When cool October robed her dewy furze<BR>In netted sheen of gold-shot gossamers,
