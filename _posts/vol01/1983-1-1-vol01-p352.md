A story must be told or there'll be no story, yet it is the untold stories that are most moving. I think you are moved by <I>Ce-lebrimbor because </I>it conveys a sudden sense of endless <I>untold </I>stories: mountains seen far away, never to be climbed, distant trees (like Niggle's) never to be approached — or if so only to become ‘near trees' . . .

Professor Shippey says that ‘to tell [the stories that are only alluded to in <I>The Lord of the Rings] </I>in their own right and expect them to retain the charm they got from their larger setting would be a terrible error’. The ‘error’ presumably lies in the holding of such an expectation, if the stories were told, not in the telling of the stories at all; and it is apparent that Professor Shippey sees my father as wondering, in 1963, whether he should or should not put pen to paper, for he expands the words of the letter, ‘I am doubtful myself about the undertaking’, to mean ‘the undertaking to write <I>The Silmarillion’ . </I>But when my father said this he was not — most
