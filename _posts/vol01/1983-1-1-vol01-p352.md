be a problem. Nor was it a new thought: while he was writing <I>The Lord of the Rings</I>, in 1945, he said in a letter to me (<I>Letters</I>, p. 110):

A story must be told or there'll be no story, yet it is the untold stories that are most moving. I think you are moved by <I>Celebrimbor</I> because it conveys a sudden sense of endless <I>untold</I> stories: mountains seen far away, never to be climbed, distant trees (like Niggle's) never to be approached — or if so only to become ‘near trees' . . .

This matter is perfectly illustrated for me by Gimli's song in Moria, where great names out of the ancient world appear utterly remote:

<SUB>1</SUB> The world was fair, the mountains tall

<SUB>2</SUB> In Elder Days before the fall

‘I like that!’ said Sam. ‘I should like to learn it. <I>In Moria, in Khazad-dûm</I>. But it makes the darkness seem heavier, thinking of all those lamps.’ By his enthusiastic ‘I like that!’ Sam not only ‘mediates’ (and engagingly ‘Gamgifies’) the ‘high’, the mighty kings of Nargothrond and Gondolin, Durin on his carven throne, but places them at once at an even remoter distance, a magical distance that it might well seem (<I>at that moment)</I> destructive to traverse.

Professor Shippey says that ‘to tell [the stories that are only alluded to in <I>The Lord of the Rings]</I> in their own right and expect them to retain the charm they got from their larger setting would be a terrible error’. The ‘error’ presumably lies in the holding of such an expectation, if the stories were told, not in the telling of the stories at all; and it is apparent that Professor Shippey sees my father as wondering, in 1963, whether he should or should not put pen to paper, for he expands the words of the letter, ‘I am doubtful myself about the undertaking’, to mean ‘the undertaking to write <I>The Silmarillion’ </I>. But when my father said this he was not — most
