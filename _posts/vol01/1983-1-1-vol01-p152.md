152      THE BOOK OF LOST TALES: PART I<BR><I>A Song of Aryador</I>
</p>

In the vales of Aryador<BR>By the wooded inland shore<BR>Green the lakeward bents and meads<BR>Sloping down to murmurous reeds<BR>That whisper in the dusk o'er Aryador:

‘Do you hear the many bells

Of the goats upon the fells Where the valley tumbles downward from the pines?

Do you hear the blue woods moan

When the Sun has gone alone<BR>To hunt the mountain-shadows in the pines?

She is lost among the hills

And the upland slowly fills With the shadow-folk that murmur in the fern;

And still there are the bells

And the voices on the fells While Eastward a few stars begin to burn.

Men are kindling tiny gleams

Far below by mountain-streams Where they dwell among the beechwoods near the shore,

But the great woods on the height

Watch the waning western light And whisper to the wind of things of yore,

When the valley was unknown,

And the waters roared alone,<BR>And the shadow-folk danced downward all the night,

When the Sun had fared abroad

Through great forests unexplored<BR>And the woods were full of wandering beams of light.

Then were voices on the fells<BR>And a sound of ghostly bells<BR>And a march of shadow-people o'er the height.<BR>In the mountains by the shore<BR>In forgotten Aryador
