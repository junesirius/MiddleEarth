<I>A Song of Aryador</I>

<SUB>1</SUB> In the vales of Aryador

<SUB>2</SUB> By the wooded inland shore

<SUB>3</SUB> Green the lakeward bents and meads

<SUB>4</SUB> Sloping down to murmurous reeds

<SUB>5</SUB> That whisper in the dusk o'er Aryador:

<SUB>6</SUB> ‘Do you hear the many bells

<SUB>7</SUB> Of the goats upon the fells

<SUB>8</SUB> Where the valley tumbles downward from the pines?

<SUB>9</SUB> Do you hear the blue woods moan

<SUB>10</SUB> When the Sun has gone alone

<SUB>11</SUB> To hunt the mountain-shadows in the pines?

<SUB>12</SUB> She is lost among the hills

<SUB>13</SUB> And the upland slowly fills

<SUB>14</SUB> With the shadow-folk that murmur in the fern;

<SUB>15</SUB> And still there are the bells

<SUB>16</SUB> And the voices on the fells 

<SUB>17</SUB> While Eastward a few stars begin to burn.

<SUB>18</SUB> Men are kindling tiny gleams

<SUB>19</SUB> Far below by mountain-streams 

<SUB>20</SUB> Where they dwell among the beechwoods near the shore,

<SUB>21</SUB> But the great woods on the height

<SUB>22</SUB> Watch the waning western light 

<SUB>23</SUB> And whisper to the wind of things of yore,

<SUB>24</SUB> When the valley was unknown,

<SUB>25</SUB> And the waters roared alone,

<SUB>26</SUB> And the shadow-folk danced downward all the night,

<SUB>27</SUB> When the Sun had fared abroad

<SUB>28</SUB> Through great forests unexplored

<SUB>29</SUB> And the woods were full of wandering beams of light.

<SUB>30</SUB> Then were voices on the fells

<SUB>31</SUB> And a sound of ghostly bells

<SUB>32</SUB> And a march of shadow-people o'er the height.

<SUB>33</SUB> In the mountains by the shore

<SUB>34</SUB> In forgotten Aryador
