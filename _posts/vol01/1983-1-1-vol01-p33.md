<p style="text-indent: 0;">
The <I>Cottage of Lost Play </I>33
</p>

115     Are wafted by slow airs to windy coasts,

And glimmering sadly down the tide are borne.<BR>Bare are thy trees become, Kortirion;<BR>The rotted raiment from their bones is gone.<BR>The seven candles of the Silver Wain,<BR>120     Like lighted tapers in a darkened fane,

Now flare above the fallen year.<BR>Though court and street now cold and empty lie,<BR>And Elves dance seldom neath the barren sky,<BR>Yet under the white moon there is a sound<BR>125     Of buried music still beneath the ground.

When winter comes, I would meet winter here.

I would not seek the desert, or red palaces

Where reigns the sun, nor sail to magic isles,<BR>Nor climb the hoary mountains' stony terraces;<BR>130        And tolling faintly over windy miles

To my heart calls no distant bell that rings   •<BR>In crowded cities of the Earthly Kings.

For here is heartsease still, and deep content,<BR>Though sadness haunt the Land of withered Elms<BR>135      (Alalminórë in the Faery Realms);

And making music still in sweet lament<BR>The Elves here holy and immortal dwell,<BR>And on the stones and trees there lies a spell.

I give lastly the final poem, in the second of two slightly different versions; composed (as I believe) nearly half a century after the first.

<I>The Trees of Kortirion</I>

<I>I<BR>Alalminórë</I>

O ancient city on a leaguered hill!

Old shadows linger in your broken gate,<BR>Your stones are grey, your old halls now are still,

Your towers silent in the mist await<BR>5     Their crumbling end, while through the storeyed<BR>elms
