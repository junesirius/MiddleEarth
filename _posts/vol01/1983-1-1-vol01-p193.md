weaknesses that after became their lot dwelling far from Valinor’, but ‘still was the blessed food of the Gods and their drink rich in their veins and they were half-divine’. This is echoed in the words of <I>The Silmarillion</I> (p. 90) that the Noldor were ‘but new-come from the Blessed Realm, and not yet weary with the weariness of Earth’. On the other hand it was specifically said in the Prophecy of the North (<I>ibid</I>. p. 88) that ‘though Eru appointed you to die not in Eä, <I>and no sickness may assail you</I>, yet slain ye may be, and slain ye shall be,’ &c.

Of the treachery of the Fëanorians, sailing away in the ships and leaving the host of Fingolfin on the shores of Ar-aman, there is of course in the old story no trace; but the blaming of Fëanor was already present (‘the Tents of Murmuring’, [p. 187]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p187)). It is a remarkable aspect of the earliest version of the mythology that while so much of the narrative structure was firm and was to endure, the later ‘genealogical’ structure had scarcely emerged. Turgon existed as the son of (Finwë) Nólemë, but there is no suggestion that Fëanor was close akin to the lord of the Noldoli, and the other princes, Fingolfin, Finarfin, Fingon, Felagund, do not appear at all, in any form, or by any name.
