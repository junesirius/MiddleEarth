their estrangement; wherefore one night he said, sitting before the Tale-fire: ‘Whence be the Sun and Moon, O Lindo? For as yet have I heard only of the Two Trees and their sad fading, but of the coming of Men, or of the deeds of the Elves beyond Valinor has no one told me. ’

Now there happened that night to be present a guest both at their board and at their tale-telling, and his name was Gilfanon, and all named him beside Gilfanon a-Davrobel,<SUP>[1]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p219)</SUP> for he came from that region of the isle where stands the Tower of Tavrobel beside the rivers,<SUP>[2]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p219)</SUP> and about it dwelt the Gnome-folk still as one people, naming the places in their own tongue. That region was Gilfanon wont to name the fairest of all the isle, and the Gnome-kin its best folk, albeit ere the coming of the folk thither long had he dwelt away from the Noldoli, faring with Ilkorins in Hisilómë and Ar-tanor,<SUP>[3]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p219)</SUP> and thereto had he become as few Elves did a great friend and companion of the Children of Men of those days. To their legends and their memories he added his own knowledge, for he had been deep-versed in many lores and tongues once in the far days of Kôr, and experience had he beside of many very ancient deeds, being indeed one of the oldest of the fairies<SUP>[4]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p219)</SUP> and the most aged that now dwelt in the isle, albeit Meril held the title of Lady of the Isle by reason of her blood.

Therefore said Lindo now, answering Eriol: ‘Behold, Gilfanon here can tell thee much of such matters, and it were well if you fared hence away with him to sojourn awhile in Tavrobel. — Nay, look not thus,’ he laughed, seeing Eriol's face, ‘for we do not banish thee yet — but of a sooth he who would drink of <I>limpë</I> were wise first to seek the guestkindli-ness of Gilfanon, in whose ancient house — the House of the Hundred Chimneys, that stands nigh the bridge of Tavrobel<SUP>[5]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p219)</SUP> — may many things be heard of both past and that are to come.’

‘Methinks,’ said Gilfanon to Eriol, ‘that Lindo seeks to rid himself of two guests at once; howso he may not do so yet, for I purpose to stay in Kortirion a sennight yet, and moreover to feast at his good board meanwhile, and stretch me by the Tale-fire too — thereafter maybe thou and I will fare away and thou shalt see the full loveliness of the fairies' isle — but now let Lindo raise up his voice and tell us yet
