Thy towers silent in the mist await<BR>5   Their crumbling end,  while through the storeyed
</p>

elms

The Gliding Water leaves these inland realms,<BR>And slips between long meadows to the Sea,<BR>Still bearing downward over murmurous falls

One day and then another to the Sea;<BR>10   And slowly thither many years have gone,<BR>Since first the Elves here built Kortirion.

O climbing town upon thy windy hill<BR>With winding streets, and alleys shady-walled

Where now untamed the peacocks pace in drill<BR>15     Majestic, sapphirine, and emerald;

Amid the girdle of this sleeping land,

Where silver falls the rain and gleaming stand<BR>The whispering host of old deep-rooted trees

That cast long shadows in many a bygone noon,<BR>20     And murmured many centuries in the breeze;

Thou art the city of the Land of Elms,

Alalminórë in the Faery Realms.

Sing of thy trees, Kortirion, again:<BR>The beech on hill, the willow in the fen,<BR>25     The rainy poplars, and the frowning yews<BR>Within thine agéd courts that muse<BR>In sombre splendour all the day;<BR>Until the twinkle of the early stars<BR>Comes glinting through their sable bars,<BR>30     And the white moon climbing up the sky

Looks down upon the ghosts of trees that die

Slowly and silently from day to day.<BR>O Lonely Isle, here was thy citadel,<BR>Ere bannered summer from his fortress fell.<BR>35     Then full of music were thine elms:

Green was their armour, green their helms,

The Lords and Kings of all thy trees.<BR>Sing, then, of elms, renowned Kortirion,

That under summer crowds their full sail on,<BR>40        And shrouded stand like masts of verdurous<BR>ships,
