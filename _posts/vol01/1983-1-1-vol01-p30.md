<SUB>4</SUB> Thy towers silent in the mist await

<SUB>5</SUB> Their crumbling end,  while through the storeyed elms

<SUB>6</SUB> The Gliding Water leaves these inland realms,

<SUB>7</SUB> And slips between long meadows to the Sea,

<SUB>8</SUB> Still bearing downward over murmurous falls

<SUB>9</SUB> One day and then another to the Sea;

<SUB>10</SUB> And slowly thither many years have gone,

<SUB>11</SUB> Since first the Elves here built Kortirion.

<SUB>12</SUB> O climbing town upon thy windy hill

<SUB>13</SUB> With winding streets, and alleys shady-walled

<SUB>14</SUB> Where now untamed the peacocks pace in drill

<SUB>15</SUB> Majestic, sapphirine, and emerald;

<SUB>16</SUB> Amid the girdle of this sleeping land,

<SUB>17</SUB> Where silver falls the rain and gleaming stand

<SUB>18</SUB> The whispering host of old deep-rooted trees

<SUB>19</SUB> That cast long shadows in many a bygone noon,

<SUB>20</SUB> And murmured many centuries in the breeze;

<SUB>21</SUB> Thou art the city of the Land of Elms,

<SUB>22</SUB> Alalminórë in the Faery Realms.

<SUB>23</SUB> Sing of thy trees, Kortirion, again:

<SUB>24</SUB> The beech on hill, the willow in the fen,

<SUB>25</SUB> The rainy poplars, and the frowning yews

<SUB>26</SUB> Within thine agéd courts that muse

<SUB>27</SUB> In sombre splendour all the day;

<SUB>28</SUB> Until the twinkle of the early stars

<SUB>29</SUB> Comes glinting through their sable bars,

<SUB>30</SUB> And the white moon climbing up the sky

<SUB>31</SUB> Looks down upon the ghosts of trees that die

<SUB>32</SUB> Slowly and silently from day to day.

<SUB>33</SUB> O Lonely Isle, here was thy citadel,

<SUB>34</SUB> Ere bannered summer from his fortress fell.

<SUB>35</SUB> Then full of music were thine elms:

<SUB>36</SUB> Green was their armour, green their helms,

<SUB>37</SUB> The Lords and Kings of all thy trees.

<SUB>38</SUB> Sing, then, of elms, renowned Kortirion,

<SUB>39</SUB> That under summer crowds their full sail on,

<SUB>40</SUB> And shrouded stand like masts of verdurous ships,
