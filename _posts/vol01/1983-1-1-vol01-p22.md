<SUB>58</SUB> And why it was Tomorrow came

<SUB>59</SUB> And with his grey hand led us back;

<SUB>60</SUB> And why we never found the same

<SUB>61</SUB> Old cottage, or the magic track

<SUB>62</SUB> That leads between a silver sea

<SUB>63</SUB> And those old shores and gardens fair

<SUB>64</SUB> Where all things are, that ever were —

<SUB>65</SUB> We know not, You and Me.

<BR>
NOTES:

<SUB>62</SUB> That leads between the sea and sky

<SUB>63</SUB> To those old shores

<SUB>65</SUB> We know not, You and I.

Lines 58-65 were subsequently rewritten:

But why it was there came a time

When we could take the road no more,

Though long we looked, and high would climb,

Or gaze from many a seaward shore

To find the path between sea and sky

To those old gardens of delight;

And how it goes now in that land,

If there the house and gardens stand,

Still filled with children clad in white —

We know not, You and I.

This is the final version of the poem:

<B>The Little House of Lost Play</B>

<I>Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva</I>

<SUB>1</SUB> We knew that land once, You and I,

<SUB>2</SUB> and once we wandered there

<SUB>3</SUB> in the long days now long gone by,

<SUB>4</SUB> a dark child and a fair.

<SUB>5</SUB> Was it on the paths of firelight thought

<SUB>6</SUB> in winter cold and white,

<SUB>7</SUB> or in the blue-spun twilit hours

<SUB>8</SUB> of little early tucked-up beds

<SUB>9</SUB> in drowsy summer night,

<SUB>10</SUB> that you and I in Sleep went down

<SUB>11</SUB> to meet each other there,

<SUB>12</SUB> your dark hair on your white nightgown

<SUB>13</SUB> and mine was tangled fair?

<SUB>14</SUB> We wandered shyly hand in hand,

<SUB>15</SUB> small footprints in the golden sand,

<SUB>16</SUB> and gathered pearls and shells in pails,

<SUB>17</SUB> while all about the nightingales
