<p style="text-indent: 0;">
And with his grey hand led us back;<BR>60      And why we never found the same<BR>Old cottage, or the magic track<BR>That leads between a silver sea<BR>And those old shores and gardens fair<BR>Where all things are, that ever were —<BR>65       We know not, You and Me.
</p>

This is the final version of the poem:

The Little House of Lost Play<BR><I>Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva</I>

We knew that land once, You and I,

and once we wandered there<BR>in the long days now long gone by,

a dark child and a fair.<BR>5       Was it on the paths of firelight thought

in winter cold and white,<BR>or in the blue-spun twilit hours<BR>of little early tucked-up beds

in drowsy summer night,<BR>10      that you and I in Sleep went down

to meet each other there,<BR>your dark hair on your white nightgown

and mine was tangled fair?

We wandered shyly hand in hand,<BR>15       small footprints in the golden sand,

and gathered pearls and shells in pails,<BR>while all about the nightingales

Though long we looked, and high would climb,<BR>Or gaze from many a seaward shore<BR>To find the path between sea and sky

To those old gardens of delight;<BR>And how it goes now in that land,<BR>If there the house and gardens stand,<BR>Still filled with children clad in white —<BR>We know not, You and I.

62 That leads between the sea and sky

63 To those old shores

65 We know not, You and I.
