<p style="text-indent: 0;">
reference to ‘Gnomes' was removed, and replaced by a passage explaining the use of the word <I>Elves</I> to translate <I>Quendi</I> and <I>Eldar</I> despite the diminishing of the English word. This passage — referring to the Quendi as a whole — continues however with the same words as in the draft: ‘They were a race high and beautiful, and among them the Eldar were as kings, who now are gone: the People of the Great Journey, the People of the Stars. They were tall, fair of skin and grey-eyed, though their locks were dark, save in the golden house of Finrod . . . ’ Thus these words describing characters of face and hair were actually written of the Noldor only, and <I>not</I> of all the Eldar: indeed the Vanyar had golden hair, and it was from Finarfin's Vanyarin mother Indis that he, and Fin-rod Felagund and Galadriel his children, had their golden hair that marked them out among the princes of the Noldor. But I am unable to determine how this extraordinary perversion of meaning arose.*

<BR>
\* The name <I>Finrod</I> in the passage at the end of Appendix F is now in error: Finarfin was Finrod, and Finrod was Inglor, until the second edition of <I>The Lord of the Kings</I>, and in this instance the change was overlooked.
