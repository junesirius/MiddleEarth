<p style="text-indent: 0;">
The River Gliding leaves these inland realms<BR>And slips between long meadows to the Sea,
</p>

Still bearing down by weir and murmuring fall

One day and then another to the Sea;<BR>10     And slowly thither many days have gone

Since first the Edain built Kortirion.

Kortirion! Upon your island hill<BR>With winding streets, and alleys shadow-walled

Where even now the peacocks pace in drill<BR>15        Majestic, sapphirine and emerald,

Once long ago amid this sleeping land

Of silver rain, where still year-laden stand<BR>In unforgetful earth the rooted trees

That cast long shadows in the bygone noon,<BR>20        And whispered in the swiftly passing breeze,

Once long ago, Queen of the Land of Elms,

High City were you of the Inland Realms.

Your trees in summer you remember still:<BR>The willow by the spring, the beech on hill;<BR>25     The rainy poplars, and the frowning yews<BR>Within your aged courts that muse

In sombre splendour all the day,<BR>Until the firstling star comes glimmering,<BR>And flittermice go by on silent wing;<BR>30     Until the white moon slowly climbing sees<BR>In shadow-fields the sleep-enchanted trees

Night-mantled all in silver-grey.<BR>Alalminor! Here was your citadel,<BR>Ere bannered summer from his fortress fell;<BR>35     About you stood arrayed your host of elms:

Green was their armour, tall and green their helms,

High lords and captains of the trees.<BR>But summer wanes. Behold, Kortirion!<BR>The elms their full sail now have crowded on<BR>40     Ready to the winds, like masts amid the vale<BR>Of mighty ships too soon, too soon, to sail

To other days beyond these sunlit seas.
