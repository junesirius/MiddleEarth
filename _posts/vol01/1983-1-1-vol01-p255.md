<p style="text-indent: 0;">
of this ignorance may be found in the radical difference in the treatment of the Creation of the World between the early and later forms of <I>The Music of the Ainur</I>. I have remarked earlier (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p60">p. 60</a>) that originally the Ainur's first sight of the world was already in its actuality, and Ilúvatar said to them: ‘even now the world unfolds and its history begins’; whereas in the developed form it was a vision that was taken away from them, and only given existence in the word of Ilúvatar: <I>Eä!</I> Let these things Be! It is said in <I>The Silmarillion</I> (p. 20) that

when the Valar entered into Eä they were at first astounded and at a loss, for it was as if naught was yet made which they had seen in vision, and all was but on point to begin and yet unshaped . . .

and there follows ([pp. 21-2]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p21)) an account of the vast labours of the Valar in the actual ‘construction’ of the world:

They built lands and Melkor destroyed them; valleys they delved and Melkor raised them up; mountains they carved and Melkor threw them down; seas they hollowed and Melkor spilled them . . .

In the old version there is none of this, and one gains the impression (though nothing is explicit) that the Valar came into a world that was already ‘made’, and unknown to them (‘the Gods stalked north and south and could see little; indeed in the deepest of these regions they found great cold and solitude . . .’, [p. 69]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p69)). Although the conception of the world was indeed derived in large measure from their own playing in the Music, its reality came from the creative act of Ilúvatar (‘We would have the guarding of those fair things of our dreams, which of thy might have now attained to reality’, [p. 55]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p55)); and the knowledge possessed by the Valar of the actual properties and dimensions of their habitation was correspondingly smaller (so we may perhaps assume) than it was afterwards conceived to be.

But this is to lean rather heavily on the matter. More probably, the ignorance of the Valar is to be attributed to their
