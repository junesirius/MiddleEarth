were rightly theirs — but notably absent from Melko's words is any reference to the coming of Men: this element is in the tale introduced later and quite differently, by Manwë himself (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p166">p. 166</a>). Moreover the particular association of the Noldoli with the evil Vala arises from his desire for their gems: in <I>The Silmarillion</I> (p. 66) the Noldor turned to him for the instruction he could give, while the other kindreds held aloof.

From this point the narratives diverge altogether; for the secret evil of Melkor was in <I>The Silmarillion</I> laid bare as a result of the enquiry held into the quarrel of the Noldorin princes, whereas here its revelation came about more simply from the anxiety of Finwë Nólemë about the unrest of his people. The later story is of course far superior, in that Melkor was sought by the Valar as a known enemy as soon as his machinations were uncovered (though he escaped), whereas in the tale, despite there being now every evidence that he was by no means reformed, he was merely told to go and think things over in Mandos. The germ of the story in <I>The Silmarillion</I> of Fëanor's banishment to Formenos, where he was accompanied by Finwë, is present, though here the entire people of the Noldoli are ordered to leave Kôr for the rugged dale northwards where the stream Híri plunged underground, and the command to do so seems to have been less a punishment meted out to them by Manwë than a precaution and a safeguard.

In connection with the place of the banishment of the Noldoli, here called <I>Sirnúmen</I> (‘Western Stream’), it may be mentioned that in an isolated note found in the little book referred to on [p. 13]({{sitp.baseurl}}/vol01-p13) it is stated: ‘The river of the second rocky dwelling of the Gnomes in Valinor was <I>kelusindi</I> and the spring at its source <I>kapalinda.’</I>

Very remarkable is the passage ([p. 156]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p156)) where Manwë is said to know that ‘the Elves were children of the world and must one day return to her bosom’. As I have noticed earlier ([pp. 83-4]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p83)) ‘the world’ is often equated with the Great Lands, and this usage occurs repeatedly in the present tale, but it is not clear to me whether this sense is intended here. I incline to think that the meaning of the phrase is that at ‘the Great End’ the Eldar, being bound to the Earth, cannot return with the Valar and spirits that were ‘before the world’ ([p. 66]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p66)) to
