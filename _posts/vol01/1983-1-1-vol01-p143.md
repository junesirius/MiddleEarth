parts of the Earth to Valinor, when afterwards the Great March was only achieved with such difficulty). The story of the questioning of the three Elves by Manwë concerning the nature of their coming into the world, and their loss of all memory of what preceded their awakening, did not survive the <I>Lost Tales</I>. A further important shift in the structure is seen in Ulmo's eager support of the party favouring the summoning of the Elves to Valinor; in <I>The Silmarillion</I> (p. 52) Ulmo was the chief of those who ‘held that the Quendi should be left free to walk as they would in Middle-earth’.

I set out here the early history of the names of the chief Eldar.

<I>Elu Thingol</I> (Quenya <I>Elwë Singollo</I>) began as <I>Linwë Tinto</I> (also simply <I>Linwë</I>); this was changed to <I>Tinwë Linto (Tinwë</I>). His Gnomish name was at first <I>Tintoglin</I>, then <I>Tinwelint</I>. He was the leader of the Solosimpi (the later Teleri) on the Great Journey, but he was beguiled in Hisilómë by the ‘fay’ <I>(Tin-driel >) Wendelin</I> (later <I>Melian)</I>, who came from the gardens of Lórien in Valinor; he became lord of the Elves of Hisilómë, and their daughter was <I>Tinúviel</I>. The leader of the Solosimpi in his place was, confusingly, <I>Ellu</I> (afterwards <I>Olwë</I>, brother of Elwë).

The lord of the Noldoli was <I>Finwë Nólemë</I> (also <I>Nólemë Finwë</I>, and most commonly simply <I>Nólemë);</I> the name <I>Finwë</I> remained throughout the history. In the Gnomish speech he was <I>Golfinweg</I>. His son was <I>Turondo</I>, in Gnomish <I>Turgon</I> (later Turgon became Finwë's grandson, being the son of Finwë's son Fingolfin).

The lord of the Teleri (afterwards the Vanyar) was <I>(Ing >) Inwë</I>, here called <I>Isil Inwë</I>, named in Gnomish <I>(Gim-githil >) Inwithiel</I>. His son, who built the great tower of Kortirion, was <I>(Ingilmo >) Ingil</I>. The ‘royal clan’ of the Teleri were the Inwir. Thus:
