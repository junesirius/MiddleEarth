the Great Lands. (When Rúmil spoke of ‘the lost bands that dwell wandering sadly in the Great Lands' who ‘maybe speak very strangely now’ he seems to have been referring to remnants of the Noldorin exiles from Kôr who had not come to Tol Eressëa (as he himself had done), rather than to Elves who never went to Valinor.)*

In the <I>Lost Tales</I> the name given to the Sea-elves afterwards called the <I>Teleri -</I> the third of the three ‘tribes' — is <I>Solosimpi</I> (‘Shoreland Pipers'). It must now be explained that, confusingly enough, the first of the tribes, that led by King Inwë, were called the <I>Teleri</I> (the <I>Vanyar</I> of <I>The Silmarillion</I>). Who then were the <I>Inwir?</I> Eriol was told later by Meril-i-Turinqi (p. 124) that the Teleri were those that followed Inwë, ‘but his kindred and descendants are that royal folk the Inwir of whose blood I am.’ The Inwir were then a ‘royal’ clan <I>within the Teleri;</I> and the relation between the old conception and that of <I>The Silmarillion</I> can be shown thus:

<I>Lost Tales     . .     . .     The Silmarillion</I>

I Teleri          . .     . .     . .     . .     . .      Vanyar

(including Inwir)

II Noldoli         . .     . .     . .     . .      Noldor

(Gnomes)

III Solosimpi       . .     . .     . .     Teleri

In this link-passage Rúmil seems to say that the ‘Eldar’ are distinct from the ‘Gnomes' — ‘akin nonetheless be assuredly Gnome-speech and Elfin of the Eldar’; and ‘Eldar’ and ‘Noldoli’ are opposed in the prose preamble to <I>Kortirion among the Trees</I> ([p. 17]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p17)). Elsewhere ‘Elfin’, as a language, is used in opposition to ‘Gnomish’, and ‘Eldar’ is used of a word of form in contradistinction to ‘Gnomish’. It is in fact made quite explicit in the <I>Lost Tales</I> that the Gnomes were

\* On the other hand it is possible that by ‘the lost bands' he did in fact mean the Elves who were lost on the journey from the Waters of Awakening (see [p. 127]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p127)); i.e. the implication is: ‘if the sundering of the speech of the Noldoli from that of the Eldar who remained in Valinor is very deep, how much more so must be the speech of those who never crossed the sea’.
