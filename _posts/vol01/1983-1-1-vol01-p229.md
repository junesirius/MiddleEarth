not written consecutively and continuously from <I>The Music</I>, while my father was still in Oxford.

At first sight, then, there is a hopeless contradiction in the evidence: for the <I>Link</I> in question refers explicitly to the Darkening of Valinor, a tale written <I>after</I> his appointment in Oxford at the end of 1918, but is a link to the <I>Tale of Tinúviel</I>, which he said that he wrote in 1917. But the <I>Tale of Tinúviel</I> (and the <I>Link</I> that precedes it) is in fact a text in ink written over an erased pencilled original. It is, I think, certain that this <I>rewriting</I> of <I>Tmúviel</I> was considerably later. It was linked to <I>The Flight of the Noldoli</I> by the speeches of Lindo and Eriol (the link-passage is integral and continuous with the <I>Tale of Tinúviel</I> that follows it, and was not added afterwards). At this stage my father must have felt that the <I>Tales</I> need not necessarily be told in the actual sequence of the narrative (for <I>Tinúviel</I> belongs of course to the time after the making of the Sun and Moon).

The rewritten <I>Tinúviel</I> was followed with no break by a first form of the ‘interlude’ introducing Gilfanon of Tavrobel as a guest in the house, and this led into the <I>Tale of the Sun and Moon</I>. But subsequently my father changed his mind, and so struck out the dialogue of Lindo and Eriol from the beginning of the <I>Link</I> to <I>Tinúviel</I>, which was not now to follow <I>The Flight of the Noldoli</I>, and wrote it out again in the other book at the end of that tale. At the same time he rewrote the Gilfanon ‘interlude’ in an extended form, and placed it at the end of <I>The Flight of the Noldoli</I>. Thus:

Flight of the Noldoli

Words of Lindo and Eriol

Tale of Tinúviel Gilfanon ‘interlude’ (rewritten)

Gilfanon ‘interlude’ Tale of the Sun and Moon

Tale of the Sun and Moon and the Hiding of Valinor and the Hiding of Valinor

That the rewriting of <I>Tinúviel</I> was one of the latest elements in the composition of the <I>Lost Tales</I> seems clear from the fact that it is followed by the first form of the Gilfanon ‘interlude’, written at the same time: for Gilfanon replaced Ailios, and Ailios, not Gilfanon, is the guest in the house in
