<p style="text-indent: 0;">
The <I>Chaining of Melko </I>117
</p>

Out through a door that swung tall and grey,<BR>20   And over the lawn, and away, away!

It was Tinfang Warble that was dancing there,<BR>Fluting and tossing his old white hair,<BR>Till it sparkled like frost in a winter moon;<BR>And the stars were about him, and blinked to his tune<BR>25   Shimmering blue like sparks in a haze,

As always they shimmer and shake when he plays.

My feet only made there the ghost of a sound<BR>On the shining white pebbles that ringed him round,<BR>Where his little feet flashed on a circle of sand,<BR>30   And the fingers were white on his flickering hand.<BR>In the wink of a star he had leapt in the air<BR>With his fluttering cap and his glistening hair;<BR>And had cast his long flute right over his back,<BR>Where it hung by a ribbon of silver and black.

35   His slim little body went fine as a shade,

And he slipped through the reeds like a mist in the glade;<BR>And he laughed like thin silver, and piped a thin note,<BR>As he flapped in the shadows his shadowy coat.<BR>O! the toes of his slippers were twisted and curled,

40   But he danced like a wind out into the world.

He is gone, and the valley is empty and bare<BR>Where lonely I stand and lonely I stare.<BR>Then suddenly out in the meadows beyond,<BR>Then back in the reeds by the shimmering pond,<BR>45   Then afar from a copse where the mosses are thick<BR>A few little notes came trillaping quick.

I leapt o'er the stream and I sped from the glade,<BR>For Tinfang Warble it was that played;<BR>I must follow the hoot of his twilight flute<BR>50   Over reed, over rush, under branch, over root,<BR>And over dim fields, and through rustling grasses<BR>That murmur and nod as the old elf passes,<BR>Over old hills and far away<BR>Where the harps of the Elvenfolk softly play.
