<SUB>114</SUB> herein their crews a while held feasting long

<SUB>115</SUB> And gorgeous ease, who now like windy ghosts

<SUB>116</SUB> Are wafted by slow airs to empty coasts;

<SUB>117</SUB> There are they sadly glimmering borne

<SUB>118</SUB> Across the plumbless ocean of oblivion.

<SUB>119</SUB> Bare are thy trees become, Kortirion,

<SUB>120</SUB> And all their summer glory swiftly gone.

<SUB>121</SUB> The seven lampads of the Silver Bear

<SUB>122</SUB> Are waxen to a wondrous flare

<SUB>123</SUB> That flames above the fallen year.

<SUB>124</SUB> Though cold thy windy squares and empty streets;

<SUB>125</SUB> Though elves dance seldom in thy pale retreats

<SUB>126</SUB> (Save on some rare and moonlit night,

<SUB>127</SUB> A flash, a whispering glint of white),

<SUB>128</SUB> Yet would I never need depart from here.

<BR>

<I>The Last Verse</I>

<SUB>129</SUB> I need not know the desert or red palaces

<SUB>130</SUB> Where dwells the sun, the great seas or the magic isles,

<SUB>131</SUB> The pinewoods piled on mountain-terraces;

<SUB>132</SUB> And calling faintly down the windy miles

<SUB>133</SUB> Touches my heart no distant bell that rings

<SUB>134</SUB> In populous cities of the Earthly Kings.

<SUB>135</SUB> Here do I find a haunting ever-near content

<SUB>136</SUB> Set midmost of the Land of withered Elms

<SUB>137</SUB> (Alalminórë of the Faery Realms);

<SUB>138</SUB> Here circling slowly in a sweet lament

<SUB>139</SUB> Linger the holy fairies and immortal elves

<SUB>140</SUB> Singing a song of faded longing to themselves.

<BR>

I give next the text of the poem as my father rewrote it in 1937, in the later of slightly variant forms.

<I>Kortirion among the Trees</I>

<I>I</I>

<SUB>1</SUB> O fading town upon an inland hill,

<SUB>2</SUB> Old shadows linger in thine ancient gate,

<SUB>3</SUB> Thy robe is grey, thine old heart now is still;
