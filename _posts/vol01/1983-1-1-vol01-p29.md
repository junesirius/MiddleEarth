The <I>Cottage of Lost Play </I>29
</p>

Wherein their crews a while held feasting long<BR>115        And gorgeous ease, who now like windy ghosts<BR>Are wafted by slow airs to empty coasts;

There are they sadly glimmering borne

Across the plumbless ocean of oblivion.<BR>Bare are thy trees become, Kortirion,<BR>120        And all their summer glory swiftly gone.<BR>The seven lampads of the Silver Bear<BR>Are waxen to a wondrous flare

That flames above the fallen year.<BR>Though cold thy windy squares and empty streets;<BR>125        Though elves dance seldom in thy pale retreats<BR>(Save on some rare and moonlit night,<BR>A flash, a whispering glint of white),

Yet would I never need depart from here.

<I>The Last Verse</I>

I need not know the desert or red palaces<BR>130       Where dwells the sun, the great seas or the magic

isles,

The pinewoods piled on mountain-terraces;<BR>And calling faintly down the windy miles<BR>Touches my heart no distant bell that rings<BR>In populous cities of the Earthly Kings.<BR>135        Here do I find a haunting ever-near content<BR>Set midmost of the Land of withered Elms<BR>(Alalminórë of the Faery Realms);

Here circling slowly in a sweet lament<BR>Linger the holy fairies and immortal elves<BR>140     Singing a song of faded longing to themselves.

I give next the text of the poem as my father rewrote it in<BR>1937, in the later of slightly variant forms.

<I>Kortirion among the Trees</I>

I

O fading town upon an inland hill,

Old shadows linger in thine ancient gate,<BR>Thy robe is grey, thine old heart now is still;
