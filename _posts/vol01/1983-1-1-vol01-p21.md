<SUB>31</SUB> And pierced with peeping lattices

<SUB>32</SUB> That looked toward the sea;

<SUB>33</SUB> And our own children's garden-plots

<SUB>34</SUB> Were there — our own forgetmenots,

<SUB>35</SUB> Red daisies, cress and mustard,

<SUB>36</SUB> And blue nemophilë.

<SUB>37</SUB> O! all the borders trimmed with box

<SUB>38</SUB> Were full of favourite flowers — of phlox,

<SUB>39</SUB> Of larkspur, pinks, and hollyhocks

<SUB>40</SUB> Beneath a red may-tree:

<SUB>41</SUB> And all the paths were full of shapes,

<SUB>42</SUB> Of tumbling happy white-clad shapes,

<SUB>43</SUB> And with them You and Me.

<SUB>44</SUB> And some had silver watering-cans

<SUB>45</SUB> And watered all their gowns,

<SUB>46</SUB> Or sprayed each other; some laid plans

<SUB>47</SUB> To build them houses, fairy towns,

<SUB>48</SUB> Or dwellings in the trees;

<SUB>49</SUB> And some were clambering on the roof;

<SUB>50</SUB> Some crooning lonely and aloof;

<SUB>51</SUB> And some were dancing fairy-rings

<SUB>52</SUB> And weaving pearly daisy-strings,

<SUB>53</SUB> Or chasing golden bees;

<SUB>54</SUB> But here and there a little pair

<SUB>55</SUB> With rosy cheeks and tangled hair

<SUB>56</SUB> Debated quaint old childish things —\*

<SUB>57</SUB> And we were one of these.

NOTES:

<SUB>37</SUB> And all the borders

<SUB>43</SUB> That laughed with You and Me.

<SUB>47</SUB> little towns

<SUB>56</SUB> Debated ancient childish things

\* This seems to echo the lines of Francis Thompson's poem <I>Daisy:</I>

Two children did we stray and talk

Wise, idle, childish things.

My father acquired the Works of Francis Thompson in 1913 and 1914.
