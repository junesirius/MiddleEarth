The <I>Cottage of Lost Play </I>21
</p>

And pierced with peeping lattices

That looked toward the sea;<BR>And our own children's garden-plots<BR>Were there — our own forgetmenots,<BR>35         Red daisies, cress and mustard,

And blue nemophilë.<BR>O! all the borders trimmed with box<BR>Were full of favourite flowers — of phlox,<BR>Of larkspur, pinks, and hollyhocks<BR>40 Beneath a red may-tree:

And all the paths were full of shapes,<BR>Of tumbling happy white-clad shapes,

And with them You and Me.<BR>And some had silver watering-cans<BR>45          And watered all their gowns,

Or sprayed each other; some laid plans<BR>To build them houses, fairy towns,

Or dwellings in the trees;<BR>And some were clambering on the roof;<BR>50         Some crooning lonely and aloof;<BR>And some were dancing fairy-rings<BR>And weaving pearly daisy-strings,

Or chasing golden bees;<BR>But here and there a little pair<BR>55       With rosy cheeks and tangled hair

Debated quaint old childish things —*

And we were one of these.<BR>And why it was Tomorrow came

37 And all the borders

43 That laughed with You and Me.

47 little towns

56 Debated ancient childish things

Lines 58-65 (pp. 21-22) were subsequently rewritten:

But why it was there came a time<BR>When we could take the road no more,

* This seems to echo the lines of Francis Thompson's poem <I>Daisy:</I>

Two children did we stray and talk<BR>Wise, idle, childish things.

My father acquired the Works of Francis Thompson in 1913 and 1914.
