of the northern part of the Great Lands, “between the seas”, whence Eriol came’. (On these names see further under <I>Eriol </I>in the Appendix on Names.)
</p>

It is not to be thought that these notes represent in all respects the story of Eriol as my father conceived it when he wrote <I>The Cottage of Lost Play — </I>in any case, it is said expressly there that <I>Eriol </I>means ‘One who dreams alone’, and that ‘of his former names the story nowhere tells’ ([p. 2]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p2)). But what is important is that (according to the view that I have formed of the earliest conceptions, apparently the best explanation of the very difficult evidence) this was still the leading idea when it was written: <I>Eriol came to Tol Eressëa from the lands to the East of the North Sea. </I>He belongs to the period preceding the Anglo-Saxon invasions of Britain (as my father, for his purposes, wished to represent it).

Later, his name changed to <I>Ǽlfwine </I>(‘Elf-friend’), the mariner became an Englishman of the ‘Anglo-Saxon period’ of English history, who sailed west over sea to Tol Eressëa — he sailed from England out into the Atlantic Ocean; and from this later conception comes the very remarkable story of <I>Ǽlfwine of England, </I>which will be given at the end of the <I>Lost Tales. </I>But in the earliest conception he was not an Englishman of England: England in the sense of the land of the English did not yet exist; for the cardinal fact (made quite explicit in extant notes) of this conception is that <I>the Elvish isle to which Eriol came was England — </I>that is to say, Tol Eressëa would become England, the land of the English, at the end of the story. Koromas or Kortirion, the town in the centre of Tol Eressëa to which Eriol comes in <I>The Cottage of Lost Play, </I>would become in after days Warwick (and the elements <I>Kor- </I>and <I>War- </I>were etymologically connected);\* Alalmi-nórë, the Land of Elms, would be Warwickshire; and Tav-robel, where Eriol sojourned for a while in Tol Eressëa, would afterwards be the Staffordshire village of Great Haywood.

\* The great tower or <I>tirion </I>that Ingil son of Inwe built (p. 4) and the great tower of Warwick Castle are not identified, but at least it is certain that Koromas had a great tower because Warwick has one.
