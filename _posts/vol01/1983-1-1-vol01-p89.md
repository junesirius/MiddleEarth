In the same passage Ulmo speaks of the islands in the seas, and says that (‘save some few that swim still unfettered’) they ‘stand now like pinnacles from their weedy depths', as is also well seen in the drawing.

It might seem a plausible idea that there was some connection (physical as well as etymological) between <I>Vai</I> and <I>Vaitya</I>, the outermost of the Three Airs, ‘wrapped dark and sluggish about the world and without it’ (at a later point in the <I>Tales</I>, [p. 203]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p203), there is a reference to ‘the dark and tenuous realm of Vaitya that is outside all’). In the next ‘phase’ of the mythical cosmology (dating from the 1930s, and very clearly and fully documented and illustrated in a work called <I>Ambarkanta</I>, The Shape of the World) the whole world is contained within <I>Vaiya</I>, a word meaning ‘fold, envelope’; Vaiya ‘is more like to sea below the Earth and more like to air above the Earth’ (which chimes with the description of the waters of Vai ([p. 68]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p68)) as very ‘thin’, so that no boat can sail on them nor fish swim in them, save the enchanted fish of Ulmo and his car); and in Vaiya below the Earth dwells Ulmo. Thus Vaiya is partly a development of Vaitya and partly of Vai.

Now since in the earliest word-list of the Qenya tongue (see the Appendix on Names) both <I>Vaitya</I> (‘the outermost air beyond the world’) and <I>Vai</I> (‘the outer ocean’) are derived from a root <I>vaya-</I> ‘enfold’, and since Vaitya in the present tale is said to be ‘wrapped about the world and without it’, one might think that Vaitya-Vai already in the early cosmology was a continuous enfolding substance, and that the later cosmology, in this point, only makes explicit what was present but unexpressed in the <I>Lost Tales</I>. But there is certainly no actual suggestion of this idea in any early writing; and when we look again at the drawing it seems untenable. For Vai is obviously <I>not</I> continuous with Vaitya; and if the appearance of Vilna in the bottom of the drawing is taken to mean that the Earth, <I>and</I> the ocean Vai in and on which it floats, were contained within the Three Airs, of which we see the reappearance of the innermost (Vilna) below the earth and Vai, then the suggestion that Vaitya-Vai were continuous is still more emphatically confounded.

There remains the baffling question of the representation of the world as a ship. In only one place is there a suggestion that my father conceived the world in such a way: the passage
