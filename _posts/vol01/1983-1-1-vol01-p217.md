upon, and the Earth is filled with slender lights and deep quick-moving shadows, and radiant dreams go with cool wings about the world, but Lórien has ruth amid his gladness, because his flower bears yet, and will for ever, the faint marks of its bruising and its fall; and all men can see them clearly.

‘But<SUP>[19]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p220)</SUP> lo,’ saith Lindo, ‘I run on ahead, for yet have I only told that the silver ship is newly built, and Ilinsor yet but first stepped aboard — and now do the Gods draw that vessel once again up the steep sides of old Taniquetil singing as they go songs of Lórien's folk that long have been dumb in Valinor. Slower was that wayfaring than the lifting of the Ship of Morn, and all the folk strain lustily at the ropes, until Oromë coming harnesses thereto a herd of wild white horses, and thus comes the vessel to the topmost place.
