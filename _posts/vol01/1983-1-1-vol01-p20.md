20       THE BOOK OF LOST TALES: PART I
</p>

You & Me<BR>and the Cottage of Lost Play

You and me — we know that land

And often have been there<BR>In the long old days, old nursery days,

A dark child and a fair.<BR>5       Was it down the paths of firelight dreams

In winter cold and white,<BR>Or in the blue-spun twilit hours<BR>Of little early tucked-up beds

In drowsy summer night,<BR>10      That You and I got lost in Sleep

And met each other there —<BR>Your dark hair on your white nightgown,

And mine was tangled fair?

We wandered shyly hand in hand,<BR>15 Or rollicked in the fairy sand

And gathered pearls and shells in pails,<BR>While all about the nightingales

Were singing in the trees.<BR>We dug for silver with our spades<BR>20         By little inland sparkling seas,

Then ran ashore through sleepy glades<BR>And down a warm and winding lane<BR>We never never found again<BR>Between high whispering trees.

25      The air was neither night or day,

But faintly dark with softest light,<BR>When first there glimmered into sight

The Cottage of Lost Play.<BR>‘Twas builded very very old<BR>30         White, and thatched with straws of gold,

1 You and I

3 In the long old days, the shining days,<BR>15 in the golden sand<BR>23 That now we cannot find again<BR>25 night nor day<BR>29 New-built it was, yet very old,
