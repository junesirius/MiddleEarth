<B>You & Me</B>

<B>and the Cottage of Lost Play</B>

<SUB>1</SUB> You and me — we know that land

<SUB>2</SUB> And often have been there

<SUB>3</SUB> In the long old days, old nursery days,

<SUB>4</SUB> A dark child and a fair.

<SUB>5</SUB> Was it down the paths of firelight dreams

<SUB>6</SUB> In winter cold and white,

<SUB>7</SUB> Or in the blue-spun twilit hours

<SUB>8</SUB> Of little early tucked-up beds

<SUB>9</SUB> In drowsy summer night,

<SUB>10</SUB> That You and I got lost in Sleep

<SUB>11</SUB> And met each other there —

<SUB>12</SUB> Your dark hair on your white nightgown,

<SUB>13</SUB> And mine was tangled fair?

<SUB>14</SUB> We wandered shyly hand in hand,

<SUB>15</SUB> Or rollicked in the fairy sand

<SUB>16</SUB> And gathered pearls and shells in pails,

<SUB>17</SUB> While all about the nightingales

<SUB>18</SUB> Were singing in the trees.

<SUB>19</SUB> We dug for silver with our spades

<SUB>20</SUB> By little inland sparkling seas,

<SUB>21</SUB> Then ran ashore through sleepy glades

<SUB>22</SUB> And down a warm and winding lane

<SUB>23</SUB> We never never found again

<SUB>24</SUB> Between high whispering trees.

<SUB>25</SUB>  The air was neither night or day,

<SUB>26</SUB> But faintly dark with softest light,

<SUB>27</SUB> When first there glimmered into sight

<SUB>28</SUB> The Cottage of Lost Play.

<SUB>29</SUB> ‘Twas builded very very old

<SUB>30</SUB> White, and thatched with straws of gold,

NOTES:

<SUB>1</SUB> You and I

<SUB>3</SUB> In the long old days, the shining days,

<SUB>15</SUB> in the golden sand

<SUB>23</SUB> That now we cannot find again

<SUB>25</SUB> night nor day

<SUB>29</SUB> New-built it was, yet very old,
