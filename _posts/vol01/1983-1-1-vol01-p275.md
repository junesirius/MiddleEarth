Bottomless Dread’, and the statement that all the Men of the North were shut in Hisilómë.

The outline D then turns to the story of Beren and Tinú-viel, with a natural connection from the tale just sketched: ‘Beren son of Egnor wandered out of Dor Lómin\* into Ar-tanor . . .’ This is to be the next story told by the Tale-fire (as also in outline B); in D the matter of <I>Gilfanon's Tale</I> is to take four nights.

If certain features are selected from these outlines, and expressed in such a way as to emphasize agreement rather than disagreement, the likeness to the narrative structure of <I>The Silmarillion</I> is readily apparent. Thus:

— The Noldoli cross the Helkaraksë and spread into Hisi-<BR>lómë, making their encampment by Asgon (Mithrim);

— They meet Ilkorin Elves (=Úmanyar);

— Fëanor dies;

— First battle with Orcs;

— A Gnomish army goes to Angband;

— Maidros captured, tortured, and maimed;

— The Sons of Fëanor depart from the host of the Elves (in<BR>D only);

— A mighty battle called the Battle of Unnumbered Tears is<BR>fought between Elves and Men and the hosts of Melko;

— Treachery of Men, corrupted by Melko, at that battle;

— But the people of Úrin (Húrin) are faithful, and do not<BR>survive it;

— The leader of the Gnomes is isolated and slain (in D only);

— Turgon and his host cut their way out, and go to Gondolin;

— Melko is wrathful because he cannot discover where Turgon has gone;

— The Fëanorians come late to the battle (in D only);

— A great cairn is piled (in D only).

These are essential features of the story that were to survive. But the unlikenesses are many and great. Most striking of all is that the entire later history of the long years of the Siege of Angband, ending with the Battle of Sudden Flame (Dagor Bragollach), of the passage of Men over the Mountains into
