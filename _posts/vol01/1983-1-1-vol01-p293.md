<I>tilkal</I>, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p106">pp. 106-7</a>. For <I>luntë</I> ‘ship’ see <I>Alqaluntë</I>. The Gnomish name is <I>Gilthalont; giltha</I> ‘white metal’ is said to be properly the same as <I>celeb</I> ‘silver’ (Q. <I>telpë)</I>, but now including <I>gais</I> ‘steel’, <I>ladog</I> ‘tin’, etc., as opposed to <I>culu</I> ‘gold’; and <I>culu</I> is said to be a poetic word for ‘gold’ but ‘also used mythically as a class name of all red and yellow metals, as <I>giltha</I> of white and grey’. See <I><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/characters#Telimpë">Telimpë</a></I>.
</p>

<B>Ilterendi</B>   In the text the fetters are called <I>Iterendi</I> ‘for they might not be filed or cleft’ ([p. 107]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p107)); but root TERE in QL has derivatives with a sense of ‘boring’ <I>(tereva</I> ‘piercing’, <I>teret</I> ‘auger, gimlet’).

<B>Ilúvatar</B> There can be no doubt that the original meaning of <I>Ilúvatar</I> was ‘Sky-father’ (in QL is found <I>atar</I> ‘father’); see <I>[Ilwë]({{site.baseurl}}/characters#Ilwë</I>).

<B>Ilverin</B>   Elvish name of Littleheart son of Bronweg. The rejected name <I>Elwenildo</I> (p. 49) contains the word <I>elwen</I> ‘heart’ given in QL; GL gives the word <I>ilf</I> ‘heart (especially used of feelings)’, and several names <I>(Ilfin(g), Ilfiniol, Ilfrith</I>) corresponding to Qenya <I>[Ilwerin]({{site.baseurl}}/characters#Ilwerin</I>).

<B>Ilwë</B> In QL the word <I>ilu</I> is glossed ‘ether, the slender airs among the stars', while in GL the Gnomish name Il<I>on</I> of Ilúvatar is said to= Qenya <I>Ilu</I>. In QL <I>ilwë</I> was first glossed ‘sky, heavens', with a later addition ‘the blue air that is about the stars, the middle layers'; to this in Gnomish corresponds <I>ilwint —</I> concerning which it is explained in GL that the true form <I>ilwi</I> or <I>ilwin</I> was perverted to <I>ilwint</I> through association with <I>gwint</I> ‘face’, as if it meant ‘face of God’. Other words found in Gnomish are <I>Ilbar, Ilbaroth</I> ‘heaven, the uttermost region beyond the world’; <I>Hador, Ilathon=Ilúvatar; il-brant</I> ‘rainbow’ (see <I>Ilweran</I>).

<B>Ilweran</B>   QL gives <I>Ilweran, Ilweranta</I> ‘rainbow’ (another word for the rainbow in Qenya is <I>Iluqinga</I>, in which <I>qinga</I> means ‘bow’; <I>qingi-</I> ‘twang, of strings, harp’). In Gnomish the corresponding forms are <I>Ilbrant</I> or <I>Ilvrant</I>, which are said in GL to be falsely associated with <I>brant</I> ‘bow (for shooting)’; the second element is related rather to <I>rantha</I> ‘arch, bridge’, as Q. <I>Ilweran (ta</I>) shows.

<B>Ingil</B>   In GL the Gnomish names of Inwë's son are <I>Gilweth</I> and <I>Githilma; Gil</I> is the star Sinus, and is said to be the
