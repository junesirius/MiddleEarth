<p style="text-indent: 0;">
<I>The Cottage of Lost Play </I>37<BR>You crossed wide seas unto this mortal shore.
</p>

Now are your trees, old grey Kortirion,<BR>Through pallid mists seen rising tall and wan,<BR>Like vessels vague that slowly drift afar<BR>110     Out, out to empty seas beyond the bar

Of cloudy ports forlorn;<BR>Leaving behind for ever havens loud,<BR>Wherein their crews a while held feasting proud<BR>In lordly ease, they now like windy ghosts<BR>115     Are wafted by cold airs to friendless coasts,

And silent down the tide are borne.<BR>Bare has your realm become, Kortirion,<BR>Stripped of its raiment, and its splendour gone.<BR>Like lighted tapers in a darkened fane<BR>120     The funeral candles of the Silver Wain

Now flare above the fallen year.<BR>Winter is come. Beneath the barren sky<BR>The Elves are silent. But they do not die!<BR>Here waiting they endure the winter fell<BR>125     And silence. Here I too will dwell;

Kortirion, I will meet the winter here.

<I>Mettanyë*</I>

I would not find the burning domes and sands<BR>Where reigns the sun, nor dare the deadly snows,

Nor seek in mountains dark the hidden lands<BR>130        Of men long lost to whom no pathway goes;

I heed no call of clamant bell that rings

Iron-tongued in the towers of earthly kings.<BR>Here on the stones and trees there lies a spell

Of unforgotten loss, of memory more blest<BR>135        Than mortal wealth. Here undefeated dwell

The Folk Immortal under withered elms,

Alalminórë once in ancient realms.

* <I>Mettanyë </I>contains <I>metta </I>‘ending’, as in <I>Ambar-metta, </I>the ending of<BR>the world <I>(The Return of the King, </I>VI.5).
