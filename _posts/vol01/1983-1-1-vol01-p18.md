erences to Inwë's hearing ‘the lament of the world’ (i.e. of the Great Lands) and to his leading the Eldar forth to the lands of Men (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p5">p. 5</a>) are the germ of the story of the coming of the Hosts of the West to the assault on Than-gorodrim: ‘The host of the Valar prepared for battle; and beneath their white banners marched the Vanyar, the people of Ingwë . . .’ <I>(The Silmarillion</I>, p. 251). Later in the <I>Tales</I> it is said to Eriol by Meril-i-Turinqi that ‘Inwë was the eldest of the Elves, and had lived yet in majesty had he not perished in that march into the world; but Ingil his son went long ago back to Valinor and is with Manwë’. In <I>The Silmarillion</I>, on the other hand, it is said of Ingwë that ‘he entered into Valinor [in the beginning of the days of the Elves] and sits at the feet of the Powers, and all Elves revere his name; but he came never back, nor looked again upon Middle-earth’ (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p53">p. 53</a>).

Lindo's words about the sojourn of Ingil in Tol Eressëa ‘after many days', and the interpretation of the name of his town Koromas as ‘the Resting of the Exiles of Kôr’, refer to the return of the Eldar from the Great Lands after the war on Melko (Melkor, Morgoth) for the deliverance of the enslaved Noldoli. His words about his father Valwë ‘who went with Noldorin to find the Gnomes' refer to an element in this story of the expedition from Kôr. \*

It is important to see, then, that (if my general interpretation is correct) in <I>The Cottage of Lost Play</I> Eriol comes to Tol Eressëa <I>in the time after</I> the Fall of Gondolin and the march of the Elves of Kôr into the Great Lands for the defeat of Melko, when the Elves who had taken part in it had returned over the sea to dwell in Tol Eressëa; but <I>before the time</I> of the ‘Faring Forth’ and the removal of Tol Eressëa to the geographical position of England. This latter element was soon lost in its entirety from the developing mythology.

Of the ‘Cottage’ itself it must be said at once that very little light can be cast on it from other writings of my

\* A little light on Lindo's references to the ringing of the Gong on the Shadowy Seas and the Sleeper in the Tower of Pearl will be shed when the story of Earendel is reached at the end of the <I>Tales</I>.
