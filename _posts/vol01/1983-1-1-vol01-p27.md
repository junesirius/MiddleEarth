<I>The Second Verses</I>

<SUB>43</SUB> Thou art the inmost province of the fading isle

<SUB>44</SUB> Where linger yet the Lonely Companies.

<SUB>45</SUB> Still, undespairing, do they sometimes slowly file

<SUB>46</SUB> Along thy paths with plaintive harmonies:

<SUB>47</SUB> The holy fairies and immortal elves

<SUB>48</SUB> That dance among the trees and sing themselves

<SUB>49</SUB> A wistful song of things that were, and could be yet.

<SUB>50</SUB> They pass and vanish in a sudden breeze,

<SUB>51</SUB> A wave of bowing grass — and we forget

<SUB>52</SUB> Their tender voices like wind-shaken bells

<SUB>53</SUB> Of flowers, their gleaming hair like golden asphodels.

<SUB>54</SUB> Spring still hath joy: thy spring is ever fair

<SUB>55</SUB> Among the trees; but drowsy summer by thy streams

<SUB>56</SUB> Already stoops to hear the secret player

<SUB>57</SUB> Pipe out beyond the tangle of her forest dreams

<SUB>58</SUB> The long thin tune that still do sing

<SUB>59</SUB> The elvish harebells nodding in a jacinth ring

<SUB>60</SUB> Upon the castle walls;

<SUB>61</SUB> Already stoops to listen to the clear cold spell

<SUB>62</SUB> Come up her sunny aisles and perfumed halls:

<SUB>63</SUB> A sad and haunting magic note,

<SUB>64</SUB> A strand of silver glass remote.

<SUB>65</SUB> Then all thy trees, old town upon a windy bent,

<SUB>66</SUB> Do loose a long sad whisper and lament;

<SUB>67</SUB> For going are the rich-hued hours, th'enchanted nights

<SUB>68</SUB> When flitting ghost-moths dance like satellites

<SUB>69</SUB> Round tapers in the moveless air;

<SUB>70</SUB> And doomed already are the radiant dawns,

<SUB>71</SUB> The fingered sunlight dripping on long lawns;

<SUB>72</SUB> The odour and the slumbrous noise of meads,

<SUB>73</SUB> When all the sorrel, flowers, and plumed weeds

<SUB>74</SUB> Go down before the scyther's share.

<SUB>75</SUB> Strange sad October robes her dewy furze

<SUB>76</SUB> In netted sheen of gold-shot gossamers,
