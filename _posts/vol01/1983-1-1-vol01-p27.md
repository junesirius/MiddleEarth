The <I>Cottage of Lost Play 27<BR>The Second Verses</I>
</p>

Thou art the inmost province of the fading isle<BR>Where linger yet the Lonely Companies.<BR>45     Still, undespairing, do they sometimes slowly file

Along thy paths with plaintive harmonies:<BR>The holy fairies and immortal elves<BR>That dance among the trees and sing themselves<BR>A wistful song of things that were, and could be

yet.<BR>50     They pass and vanish in a sudden breeze,

A wave of bowing grass — and we forget<BR>Their tender voices like wind-shaken bells<BR>Of flowers, their gleaming hair like golden<BR>asphodels.

Spring still hath joy: thy spring is ever fair<BR>55        Among the trees; but drowsy summer by thy

streams<BR>Already stoops to hear the secret player

Pipe out beyond the tangle of her forest dreams<BR>The long thin tune that still do sing<BR>The elvish harebells nodding in a jacinth ring<BR>60       Upon the castle walls;

Already stoops to listen to the clear cold spell

Come up her sunny aisles and perfumed halls:<BR>A sad and haunting magic note,<BR>A strand of silver glass remote.

65     Then all thy trees, old town upon a windy bent,<BR>Do loose a long sad whisper and lament;<BR>For going are the rich-hued hours, th'enchanted

nights<BR>When flitting ghost-moths dance like satellites

Round tapers in the moveless air;<BR>70     And doomed already are the radiant dawns,<BR>The fingered sunlight dripping on long lawns;<BR>The odour and the slumbrous noise of meads,<BR>When all the sorrel, flowers, and plumed weeds

Go down before the scyther's share.<BR>75      Strange sad October robes her dewy furze<BR>In netted sheen of gold-shot gossamers,
