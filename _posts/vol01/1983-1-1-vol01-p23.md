<SUB>18</SUB> were singing in the trees.

<SUB>19</SUB> We dug for silver with our spades,

<SUB>20</SUB> and caught the sparkle of the seas,

<SUB>21</SUB> then ran ashore to greenlit glades,

<SUB>22</SUB> and found the warm and winding lane

<SUB>23</SUB> that now we cannot find again,

<SUB>24</SUB> between tall whispering trees.

<SUB>25</SUB> The air was neither night nor day,

<SUB>26</SUB> an ever-eve of gloaming light,

<SUB>27</SUB> when first there glimmered into sight

<SUB>28</SUB> the Little House of Play.

<SUB>29</SUB> New-built it was, yet very old,

<SUB>30</SUB> white, and thatched with straws of gold,

<SUB>31</SUB> and pierced with peeping lattices

<SUB>32</SUB> that looked toward the sea;

<SUB>33</SUB> and our own children's garden-plots

<SUB>34</SUB> were there: our own forgetmenots,

<SUB>35</SUB> red daisies, cress and mustard,

<SUB>36</SUB> and radishes for tea.

<SUB>37</SUB> There all the borders, trimmed with box,

<SUB>38</SUB> were filled with favourite flowers, with phlox,

<SUB>39</SUB> with lupins, pinks, and hollyhocks,

<SUB>40</SUB> beneath a red may-tree;

<SUB>41</SUB> and all the gardens full of folk

<SUB>42</SUB> that their own little language spoke,

<SUB>43</SUB> but not to You and Me.

<SUB>44</SUB> For some had silver watering-cans

<SUB>45</SUB> and watered all their gowns,

<SUB>46</SUB> or sprayed each other; some laid plans

<SUB>47</SUB> to build their houses, little towns

<SUB>48</SUB> and dwellings in the trees.

<SUB>49</SUB> And some were clambering on the roof;

<SUB>50</SUB> some crooning lonely and aloof;

<SUB>51</SUB> some dancing round the fairy-rings

<SUB>52</SUB> all garlanded in daisy-strings,

<SUB>53</SUB> while some upon their knees

<SUB>54</SUB> before a little white-robed king

<SUB>55</SUB> crowned with marigold would sing

<SUB>56</SUB>their rhymes of long ago.

<SUB>57</SUB> But side by side a little pair

<SUB>58</SUB> with heads together, mingled hair,
