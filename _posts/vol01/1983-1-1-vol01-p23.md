were singing in the trees.<BR>We dug for silver with our spades,<BR>20      and caught the sparkle of the seas,<BR>then ran ashore to greenlit glades,<BR>and found the warm and winding lane<BR>that now we cannot find again,

between tall whispering trees.

And some were clambering on the roof;<BR>50       some crooning lonely and aloof;

some dancing round the fairy-rings

all garlanded in daisy-strings,<BR>while some upon their knees

before a little white-robed king<BR>55       crowned with marigold would sing<BR>their rhymes of long ago.

But side by side a little pair

with heads together, mingled hair,
