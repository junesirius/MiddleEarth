in the earliest account, though the germ of the idea of the long wait of the lastcomers for Ulmo's return is present. In the published version the cause of Ossë's rage against the transportation of the Eldar on the floating island has disappeared, and his motive for anchoring the island in the ocean is wholly different: indeed he did this at the bidding of Ulmo <I>(ibid</I>. p. 59), who was opposed to the summoning of the Eldar to Valinor in any case. But the anchoring of Tol Eressëa as a rebellious act of Ossë's long remained an element in the story. It is not made clear what other ‘scattered islands of his domain’ (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p130">p. 130</a>) Ossë anchored to the sea-bottom; but since on the drawing of the World-Ship the Lonely Isle, the Magic Isles, and the Twilit Isles are all shown in the same way as ‘standing like pinnacles from the weedy depths' (see <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p87">pp. 87-9</a>) it was probably these that Ossë now established (though Rúmil and Meril still speak of the Twilit Isles as ‘floating’ on the Shadowy Seas, pp. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p68">68</a>, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p135">135</a>).

In the old story it is made very clear that Tol Eressëa was made fast far out in the mid-ocean, and ‘no land may be seen for many leagues' sail from its cliffs'. That was indeed the reason for its name, which was diminished when the Lonely Isle came to be set in the Bay of Eldamar. But the words used of Tol Eressëa, ‘the Lonely Isle, that looks both west and east’, in the last chapter of <I>The Silmarillion</I> (relatively very little worked on and revised), undoubtedly derive from the old story; in the tale of <I>Ǽlfwine of England</I> is seen the origin of this phrase: ‘the Lonely Island looking East to the Magic Archipelago and to the lands of Men beyond it, and West into the Shadows beyond which afar off is glimpsed the Outer Land, the kingdom of the Gods'. The deep sundering of the speech of the Solosimpi from that of the other kindreds, referred to in this tale ([p. 130]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p130)), is preserved in <I>The Silmarillion</I>, but the idea arose in the days when Tol Eressëa was far further removed from Valinor.

As is very often to be observed in the evolution of these myths, an early idea survived in a wholly altered context: here, the growth of trees and plants on the westward slopes of the floating island began with its twice lying in the Bay of Faery and catching the light of the Trees when the Teleri and Noldoli disembarked, and its greater beauty and fertility remained
