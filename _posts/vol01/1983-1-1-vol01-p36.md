Round tapers in the windless air.<BR>75     Lammas is gone. The Harvest-moon has waned.<BR>Summer is dying that so briefly reigned.<BR>Now the proud elms at last begin to quail,<BR>Their leaves uncounted tremble and grow pale,
</p>

Seeing afar the icy spears<BR>80     Of winter march to battle with the sun.

When bright All-Hallows fades, their day is done,<BR>And borne on wings of amber wan they fly<BR>In heedless winds beneath the sullen sky,<BR>And fall like dying birds upon the meres.

85      Alas! Kortirion, Queen of Elms, alas!

This season best befits your ancient town<BR>With echoing voices sad that slowly pass,

Winding with waning music faintly down<BR>The paths of stranded mist. O fading time,<BR>90     When morning rises late all hoar with rime,<BR>And early shadows veil the distant woods!<BR>Unseen the Elves go by, their shining hair

They cloak in twilight under secret hoods<BR>Of grey, their dusk-blue mantles gird with bands<BR>95      Of frosted starlight sewn by silver hands.

At night they dance beneath the roofless sky,

When naked elms entwine in branching lace<BR>The Seven Stars, and through the boughs the eye

Stares down cold-gleaming in the high moon's face.<BR>100     O Elder Kindred, fair immortal folk!

You sing now ancient songs that once awoke

Under primeval stars before the Dawn;<BR>You dance like shimmering shadows in the wind,

As once you danced upon the shining lawn<BR>105     Of Elvenhome, before we were, before
