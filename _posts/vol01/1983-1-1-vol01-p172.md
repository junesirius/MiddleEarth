Changes made to names in <I>The Theft of Melko and the Darkening of Valinor</I>

<I>Ellu Melemno < Melemno</I> (in Chapter V, [p. 129]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p129), in an added sentence, the leader of the Solosimpi is <I>Ellu</I>).

<I>Sirnúmen    < Numessir</I> (at the first two occurrences; subsequently <I>Sirnúmen</I> was the form first written).

<I>Eruman    < Harmalin</I> (pp. [160]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p160), [168]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p168)), < <I>Habbanan</I> ([p. 167]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p167)).

<I>Arvalin    < Harvalien < Habbanan</I> ([p. 160]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p160)), < <I>Harvalien < Harmalin</I> ([p. 162]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p162)); <I>Arvalien</I> thus first written [p. 164]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p164).

<I>Bruithwir</I> replaces an earlier name, probably <I>Maron</I>.

<I>Bruithwir go-Maidros < Bruithwir go-Fëanor. go-</I> is a patronymic, ‘son of. See [p. 171]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p171), notes 3 and 5.

<I>Móru</I> This name could equally well be read, as also at its occasional occurrences elsewhere, as <I>Mom</I> (see the Appendix on Names). It replaces here another name, probably <I>Mordi</I>.

<I>Ungoliont    < Gungliont</I>.

<I>Daurin (Tórin) </I> The original reading at the first occurence was<BR><I>Fëanor</I>, changed to (?)<I>Daurlas ........ akin to Fëanor</I>,

and then to <I>a Gnome called Daurin (Tórin</I>). The subsequent occurrences of <I>Daurin</I> are emendations of <I>Fëanor</I>.

Commentary on <I>The Theft of Melko and the Darkening of Valinor</I>

The story of the corruption of the Noldoli by Melko was ultimately told quite differently; for there entered the matter of the strife between Finwë's sons Fëanor and Fingolfin <I>(The Silmarillion p</I>. 69), of which in the tale there is no trace, and where in any case Fëanor is not the son of Finwë Nólemë but of one Bruithwir. The primary motive in the later story of Melkor's desire for the Silmarils <I>(ibid. p</I>. 67) is here represented only by a lust for the gems of the Noldoli in general: it is indeed a remarkable feature of the original mythology that though the Silmarils were present they were of such relatively small importance. There is essential agreement with the later story in its being the Noldoli at whom Melko aimed his attack, and there is a quite close, if limited, similarity in the arguments he used: the confinement of the Elves in Valinor by the Valar, and the broad realms in the East that
