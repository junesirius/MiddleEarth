<SUB>77</SUB> And then the wide-umbraged elm begins to fail;

<SUB>78</SUB> Her mourning multitudes of leaves go pale

<SUB>79</SUB> Seeing afar the icy shears

<SUB>80</SUB> Of Winter, and his blue-tipped spears

<SUB>81</SUB> Marching unconquerable upon the sun

<SUB>82</SUB> Of bright All-Hallows. Then their hour is done,

<SUB>83</SUB> And wanly borne on wings of amber pale

<SUB>84</SUB> They beat the wide airs of the fading vale

<SUB>85</SUB> And fly like birds across the misty meres.

<SUB>86</SUB> Yet is this season dearest to my heart,

<SUB>87</SUB> Most fitting to the little faded town

<SUB>88</SUB> With sense of splendid pomps that now depart

<SUB>89</SUB> In mellow sounds of sadness echoing down

<SUB>90</SUB> The paths of stranded mists. O! gentle time

<SUB>91</SUB> When the late mornings are bejewelled with rime,

<SUB>92</SUB> And the blue shadows gather on the distant woods.

<SUB>93</SUB> The fairies know thy early crystal dusk

<SUB>94</SUB> And put in secret on their twilit hoods

<SUB>95</SUB> Of grey and filmy purple, and long bands

<SUB>96</SUB> Of frosted starlight sewn by silver hands.

<SUB>97</SUB> They know the season of the brilliant night,

<SUB>98</SUB> When naked elms entwine in cloudy lace

<SUB>99</SUB> The Pleiades, and long-armed poplars bar the light

<SUB>100</SUB> Of golden-rondured moons with glorious face.

<SUB>101</SUB> O fading fairies and most lonely elves

<SUB>102</SUB> Then sing ye, sing ye to yourselves

<SUB>103</SUB> A woven song of stars and gleaming leaves;

<SUB>104</SUB> Then whirl ye with the sapphire-winged winds;

<SUB>105</SUB> Then do ye pipe and call with heart that grieves

<SUB>106</SUB> To sombre men: ‘Remember what is gone —

<SUB>107</SUB> The magic sun that lit Kortirion! ’

<SUB>108</SUB> Now are thy trees, old, old Kortirion,

<SUB>109</SUB> Seen rising up through pallid mists and wan,

<SUB>110</SUB> Like vessels floating vague and long afar

<SUB>111</SUB> Down opal seas beyond the shadowy bar

<SUB>112</SUB> Of cloudy ports forlorn:

<SUB>113</SUB> They leave behind for ever havens throng'd
