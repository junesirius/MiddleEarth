<p style="text-indent: 0;">
And then the wide-umbraged elm begins to fail;<BR>Her mourning multitudes of leaves go pale<BR>Seeing afar the icy shears
</p>

80        Of Winter, and his blue-tipped spears<BR>Marching unconquerable upon the sun<BR>Of bright All-Hallows. Then their hour is done,<BR>And wanly borne on wings of amber pale<BR>They beat the wide airs of the fading vale

85        And fly like birds across the misty meres.

<I>The Third Verses</I>

Yet is this season dearest to my heart,

Most fitting to the little faded town<BR>With sense of splendid pomps that now depart

In mellow sounds of sadness echoing down<BR>90     The paths of stranded mists. O! gentle time

When the late mornings are bejewelled with rime,

And the blue shadows gather on the distant woods.<BR>The fairies know thy early crystal dusk

And put in secret on their twilit hoods<BR>95      Of grey and filmy purple, and long bands<BR>Of frosted starlight sewn by silver hands.

They know the season of the brilliant night,<BR>When naked elms entwine in cloudy lace

The Pleiades, and long-armed poplars bar the light<BR>100        Of golden-rondured moons with glorious face.

O fading fairies and most lonely elves

Then sing ye, sing ye to yourselves<BR>A woven song of stars and gleaming leaves;

Then whirl ye with the sapphire-winged winds;<BR>105        Then do ye pipe and call with heart that grieves

To sombre men: ‘Remember what is gone —

The magic sun that lit Kortirion! ’

Now are thy trees, old, old Kortirion,<BR>Seen rising up through pallid mists and wan,<BR>110        Like vessels floating vague and long afar<BR>Down opal seas beyond the shadowy bar

Of cloudy ports forlorn:<BR>They leave behind for ever havens throng'd
