Now did Nuin descend deeper into the vale, treading softly by reason of some unknown wonder that possessed him, and lo, beneath the trees he saw the warm dusk full of sleeping forms, and some were twined each in the other's arms, and some lay sleeping gently all alone, and Nuin stood and marvelled, scarce breathing.

Then seized with a sudden fear he turned and stole from that hallowed place, and coming again by the passage through the mountain he sped back to the abode of Tû; and coming before that oldest of wizards he said unto him that he was new come from the Eastward Lands, and Tû was little pleased thereat; nor any the more when Nuin made an end of his tale, telling of all he there saw — “and methought,” said he, “that all who slumbered there were children, yet was their stature that of the greatest of the Elves.”

There is no doubt that the former of these, which for the purposes of this chapter I will call 'B', was composed when the <I>Lost Tales</I> had reached their furthest point of development, as represented by the latest texts and arrangements given in this book. Now when this outline comes to the matter of <I>Gilfanon's Tale</I> it becomes at
