formally stated, and the different fates of Elves and Men. In this connection, the following curious matter may be mentioned. Early in the text just given (p. 50) occurs the sentence: ‘It is said that a mightier [music] far shall be woven before the seat of Ilúvatar by the choirs of both Ainur <I>and the sons of Men </I>after the Great End’; and in the concluding sentence of the text: ‘Yet while <I>the sons of Men </I>will after the passing of things of a certainty join in the Second Music of the Ainur, what Ilúvatar has devised for the Eldar beyond the world's end he has not revealed even to the Valar, and Melko has not discovered it. ’ Now in the first revision of the <I>Ainu-lindalë </I>(which dates from the 1930s) the first of these sentences was changed to read: ’. . . by the choirs of the Ainur <I>and the Children of Ilúvatar </I>after the end of days'; whereas the second remained, in this essential, unchanged. This remained the case right through to the final version. It is possible that the change in the first passage was unintentional, the substitution of another common phrase, and that this was never subsequently picked up. However, in the published work (pp. 15, 42) I left the two passages as they stand.
