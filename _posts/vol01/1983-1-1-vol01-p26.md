<p style="text-indent: 0;">
The castle only, frowning, ever waits<BR>5   And ponders how among the towering elms<BR>The Gliding Water leaves these inland realms
</p>

And slips between long meadows to the western sea —<BR>Still bearing downward over murmurous falls

One year and then another to the sea;<BR>10   And slowly thither have a many gone<BR>Since first the fairies built Kortirion.

O spiry town upon a windy hill<BR>With sudden-winding alleys shady-walled

(Where even now the peacocks pace a stately drill,<BR>15     Majestic, sapphirine, and emerald),

Behold they girdle of a wide champain

Sunlit, and watered with a silver rain,<BR>And richly wooded with a thousand whispering trees

That cast long shadows in many a bygone noon,<BR>20     And murmured many centuries in the breeze.

Thou art the city of the Land of Elms,

Alalminórë in the Faery Realms.

Sing of thy trees, old, old Kortirion!

Thine oaks, and maples with their tassels on,<BR>25     Thy singing poplars; and the splendid yews

That crown thine agéd walls and muse<BR>Of sombre grandeur all the day —

Until the twinkle of the early stars

Is tangled palely in their sable bars;<BR>30     Until the seven lampads of the Silver Bear

Swing slowly in their shrouded hair<BR>And diadem the fallen day.

O tower and citadel of the world!

When bannered summer is unfurled<BR>35      Most full of music are thine elms —

A gathered sound that overwhelms<BR>The voices of all other trees.

Sing then of elms, belov'd Kortirion,

How summer crowds their full sails on,<BR>40     Like clothed masts of verdurous ships,

A fleet of galleons that proudly slips<BR>Across long sunlit seas.
