for stylistic rather than narrative reasons; but these emendations, as will be seen, were not all made at the same time. Some of them are written out on separate slips, and of these several have on their reverse sides parts of an etymological discussion of certain Germanic words for the Butcherbird or Shrike, material which appears in the Oxford Dictionary in the entry <I>Wariangle</I>. Taken with the fact that one of the slips with this material on the reverse clearly contains a direction for the shortening of the tale when delivered orally (see note 21), it is virtually certain that a good deal of the revision of <I>Tuor B</I> was made before my father read it to the Essay Club of Exeter College in the spring of 1920 (see <I>Unfinished Tales p. 5</I>).

That not all the emendations to <I>Tuor B</I> were made at the same time is shown by the existence of a typescript (<I>Tuor C</I>), without title, which extends only so far as ‘your hill of vigilance against the evil of Melko’ (p. 161). This was taken from <I>Tuor B</I> when some changes had been made to it, but not those which I deduce to have been made before the occasion when it was read aloud. An odd feature of this text is that blanks were left for many of the names, and only some were filled in afterwards. Towards the end of it there is a good deal of independent variation from <I>Tuor B</I>, but it is all of a minor character and none has narrative significance. I conclude that this was a side-branch that petered out.

The textual history can then be represented thus:

Tuor A (original 1916-17 text in pencil)

\*<BR>heavily revised and in the later parts entirely overwritten

Tuor B (fair copy)<BR>minor stylistic revisions (and changes to names)

Tuor C (typescript; does not<BR>extend far; minor stylistic<BR>changes)

further alterations mainly on inserted

slips (and further changes to names)

before reading it at Exeter College in

1920

(the text in this book)

Since the narrative itself underwent very little change of note in the course of this history (granted that substantial parts of the original text <I>Tuor A</I> are almost entirely illegible), the text that follows here is that of <I>Tuor B</I> in its final form, with some interesting earlier readings given in the Notes. It seems that my father did not check the fair copy <I>Tuor B</I> against the original, and did not in every case pick up the errors of
