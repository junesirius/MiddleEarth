Tol Eressëa! ‘Very empty thereafter were the places of Men for Ælfwine and his mariners, and of their seed have been many restless and wistful folk since they were dead . . .’ Moreover my father seems clearly to have been going to say the same in <I>Ælfwine II</I>, but stopped, struck out what he had written, and introduced the sentence in which Ælfwine leapt into the sea. I cannot see any way to explain this.
</p>

<I>Ælfwine A</I> ends in much the same way as <I>Ælfwine II:</I>

As night comes on a little breath springs up and the clouds lift. They hoist sail to return - when suddenly low down in the dusk they see the many lights of the Haven of Many Hues twinkle forth. They row thither, and hear sweet music. Then the mist wraps all away and the others rousing themselves say it is a mirage born of hunger, and with heavy hearts prepare to go back, but Ælfwine plunges overboard and swims into the dark until he is overcome in the waters, and him seems death envelops him. The others sail away home and are out of the tale.

43 Literally, as he maintained: ‘From that (grief) one moved on; from this in the same way one can move on.’

44 There are long roots beneath the words of <I>The Fellowship of the Ring</I> (I.2): ‘Elves . . . could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening, passing and not returning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and were no longer concerned with its troubles.’ ‘“That isn't anything new, if you believe the old tales,’” said Ted Sandyman, when Sam Gamgee spoke of the matter.

I append here a synopsis of the structural differences between the<BR>three versions of <I>Ælfwine of England</I>.
