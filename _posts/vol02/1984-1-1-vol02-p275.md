<p style="text-indent: 0;">
I know a window in a Western tower
</p>

that opens on celestial seas,

and there from wells of dark behind the stars

blows ever cold a keen unearthly breeze.

It is a white tower builded on the Twilit Isles, 5

and springing from their everlasting shade

it glimmers like a house of lonely pearl,

where lights forlorn take harbour ere they fade.

Its feet are washed by waves that never rest.

There silent boats go by into the West 1 o

all piled and twinkling in the dark

with orient fire in many a hoarded spark

that divers won

in waters of the rumoured Sun.

There sometimes throbs below a silver harp, 15

touching the heart with sudden music sharp;

or far beneath the mountains high and sheer

the voices of grey sailors echo clear,

afloat among the shadows of the world

in oarless ships and with their canvas furled, 20

chanting a farewell and a solemn song:

for wide the sea is, and the journey long.

O happy mariners upon a journey far,

beyond the grey islands and past Gondobar,

to those great portals on the final shores 25

where far away constellate fountains leap,

and dashed against Night's dragon-headed doors

in foam of stars fall sparkling in the deep!

While I, alone, look out behind the moon

from in my white and windy tower, 30

ye bide no moment and await no hour,

but go with solemn song and harpers' tune

through the dark shadows and the shadowy seas

to the last land of the Two Trees,

whose fruit and flower are moon and sun, 35

where light of earth is ended and begun.
