<p style="text-indent: 0;">
And now no more they sing, nor reap, nor sow,<BR>And I perforce in many a town about this isle<BR>Unsettled wanderer have dwelt awhile.
</p>

<I>The Town of Dreams</I>

Here many days once gently past me crept<BR>In this dear town of old forgetfulness;<BR>Here all entwined in dreams once long I slept<BR>And heard no echo of the world's distress<BR>Come through the rustle of the elms' rich leaves,<BR>While Avon gurgling over shallows wove<BR>Unending melody, and morns and eves<BR>Slipped down her waters till the Autumn came,<BR>(Like the gold leaves that drip and flutter then,<BR>Till the dark river gleams with jets of flame<BR>That slowly float far down beyond our ken.)

For here the castle and the mighty tower,

More lofty than the tiered elms,

More grey than long November rain,

Sleep, and nor sunlit moment nor triumphal hour,

Nor passing of the seasons or the Sun

Wakes their old lords too long in slumber lain.

No watchfulness disturbs their splendid dream,

Though laughing radiance dance down the stream;

And be they clad in snow or lashed by windy rains,

Or may March whirl the dust about the winding lanes,

The Elm robe and disrobe her of a million leaves

Like moments clustered in a crowded year,

Still their old heart unmoved nor weeps nor grieves,

Uncomprehending of this evil tide,

Today's great sadness, or Tomorrow's fear:

Faint echoes fade within their drowsy halls

Like ghosts; the daylight creeps across their walls.
