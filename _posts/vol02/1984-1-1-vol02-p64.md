shut in Hisilómë by Melko’, and Men called them the Shadow Folk, and feared them. But in the <I>Tale of Tinúviel</I> the conception has changed. Tinwelint is now a king ruling, not in Hisilómë, but in Artanor.* (It is not said where it was that he came upon Gwendeling.)
</p>

In the account (manuscript version only, see pp. 9, 42) of Tinwelint's people there is mention of Elves ‘who remained in the dark’; and this obviously refers to Elves who never left the Waters of Awakening. (Of course those who were lost on the march from Palisor also never left ‘the dark’ (i.e. they never came to the light of the Trees), but the distinction made in this sentence is not between the darkness and the light but between those who <I>remained</I> and those who <I>set out).</I> On the emergence of this idea in the course of the writing of the <I>Last Tales</I> see 1.234. Of Tinwelint's subjects ‘the most were Ilkorindi’, and they must be those who ‘had been lost upon the march from Palisor’ (earlier, ‘the Lost Elves of Hisilómë’).

Here, a major difference in essential conception between the old legend and the form in <I>The Silmarillion</I> is apparent. These Ilkorindi of Tinwelint's following (‘eerie and strange beings' whose ‘dark songs and chantings . . . faded in the wooded places or echoed in deep caves') are described in terms applicable to the wild Avari (‘the Unwilling’) of <I>The Silmarillion</I>; but they are of course actually the precursors of the Grey-elves of Doriath. The term <I>Eldar</I> is here equivalent to <I>Elves</I> (‘all the Eldar both <I>those who remained in the dark</I> or had been lost upon the march from Palisor’) and is not restricted to those who made, or at least embarked on, the Great Journey; all were Ilkorindi - Dark Elves - if they never passed over the Sea. The later significance of the Great Journey in conferring ‘Eldarin’ status was an aspect of the elevation of the Grey-elves of Beleriand, bringing about a distinction of the utmost importance within the category of the <I>Moriquendi</I> or ‘Elves of the Darkness’ - the <I>Avari</I> (who were not Eldar) and the <I>Úmanyar</I> (the Eldar who were ‘not of Aman’): see the table ‘The Sundering of the Elves' given in <I>The Silmarillion.</I> Thus:
