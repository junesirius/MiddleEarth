In addition, there are two texts in which a part of <I>The City of Present Sorrow</I> is treated as a separate entity. This begins with 'O agéd city of an all too brief sojourn’, and is briefer: after the line ‘Thinking no more of other cities it has known’ it ends:
</p>

Forgetting for a while that all men weep<BR>It strays there happy and to thee it sings<BR>‘No tide of evil can thy glory drown,<BR>Robed in sad majesty, the stars thy crown!’

This was first called <I>The Sorrowful City</I>, but the title was then changed to <I>Wínsele wéste, windge reste réte berofene (Beowulf</I> lines 2456-7, very slightly adapted: ‘the hall of feasting empty, the resting places swept by the wind, robbed of laughter’).

There are also two manuscripts in which <I>The Town of Dreams</I> is treated as a separate poem, with a subtitle <I>An old town revisited;</I> in one of these the primary title was later changed to <I>The Town of Dead Days</I>.

Lastly, there is a poem in two parts called <I>The Song of Eriol</I>. This is found in three manuscripts, the later ones incorporating minor changes made to the predecessor (but the third has only the second part of the poem).

<I>The Song of Eriol</I>

Eriol made a song in the Room of the Tale-fire telling how his feet were set to wandering, so that in the end he found the Lonely Isle and that fairest town Kortirion.

In unknown days my fathers' sires<BR>Came, and from son to son took root<BR>Among the orchards and the river-meads<BR>And the long grasses of the fragrant plain:

Many a summer saw they kindle yellow fires<BR>Of flaglilies among the bowing reeds,<BR>And many a sea of blossom turn to golden fruit<BR>In walled gardens of the great champain.

There daffodils among the ordered trees

Did nod in spring, and men laughed deep and long

Singing as they laboured happy lays

And lighting even with a drinking-song.
