And she said: ‘There everlastingly thy naked self shall endure the torment of his scorn, pierced by his eyes, unless thou yield to me the mastery of thy tower.’
</p>

Then Sauron yielded himself, and Lúthien took the mastery of the isle and all that was there. . . .

Then Lúthien stood upon the bridge, and declared her power: and the spell was loosed that bound stone to stone, and the gates were thrown down, and the walls opened, and the pits laid bare.

Here again the actual matter of the narrative is totally different in the early and late forms of the legend: in <I>The Silmarillion</I> ‘many thralls and captives came forth in wonder and dismay . . . for they had lain long in the darkness of Sauron’, whereas in the tale the inmates who emerged from the shaken dwelling (other than Beren and the apparently inconsequent figure of the blind slave-Gnome Gimli) were a host of cats, reduced by the breaking of Tevildo's spell to ‘puny size’. (If my father had used in the tale names other than Huan, Beren, and Tinúviel, and in the absence of all other knowledge, including that of authorship, it would not be easy to demonstrate from a simple comparison between this part of the Tale and the story as told in <I>The Silmarillion</I> that the resemblances were more than superficial and accidental.)

A more minor narrative point may be noticed here. The typescript<BR>version would presumably have treated the fight of Huan and Tevildo
