arrows, and Cranthor beside him. Yet in the end were the sons of Fëanor masters of the field of slain, and the brown Elves and the green were scattered over all the lands unhappy, for they would not hearken to Maidros the maimed, nor to Curufin and Damrod who had slain their lord; and it is said that even on the day of that battle of the Elves Melko sought against Gondolin, and the fortunes of the Elves came to their uttermost waning.

Now was naught left of the seed of Beren Ermabwed son of Egnor save Elwing the Lovely, and she wandered in the woods, and of the brown Elves and the green a few gathered to her, and they departed for ever from the glades of Hithlum and got them to the south towards Sirion's deep waters, and the pleasant lands.

And thus did all the fates of the fairies weave then to one strand, and that strand is the great tale of Eärendel; and to that tale's true beginning are we now come.’

Then said Ailios: ‘And methinks that is tale enow for this time of telling.’

NOTES

1     This sentence is a rewriting of the text, which had originally:

“Nay then, know ye not that this gold belongs to the kindred of the Elves, who won it from the earth long time ago, and no one among Men has claim . . .”

The remainder of this scene, ending with the slaughter of Úrin's band, was rewritten at many points, with the same object as in the passage just cited — to convert Úrin's band from Men to Elves, as was done also at the end of Eltas’ tale (see p. 118 note 33). Thus original ‘Elves' waschanged to ‘Elves of the wood, woodland Elves', and original ‘Men’ to ‘folk, outlaws'; and see notes 2, 3, 5.

2   The original sentence here was:

Doughty were those Men and great wielders of sword and axe, and still in those unfaded days might mortal weapons wound the bodies of the elfin-folk.

See note 1.

3   The original sentence here was: ‘and those Men being wildered with<BR>magics'. See note 1.

4   This sentence, from ‘and yet another sorrow . . .’, was added to the<BR>text later.

5   ‘those’: the text has ‘the Men’, obviously left unchanged through<BR>oversight. See note 1.
