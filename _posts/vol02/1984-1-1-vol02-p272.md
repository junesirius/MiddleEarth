<p style="text-indent: 0;">
With their moonlit pebbled strand
</p>

Whose foam is silver music 15

On the opalescent floor

Beyond the great sea-shadows

On the marches of the sand

That stretches on for ever

To the dragonheaded door, 20

The gateway of the Moon,

Beyond Taniquetil

In Valinor.

West of the Sun, east of the Moon

Lies the haven of the star, 25

The white town of the Wanderer

And the rocks of Eglamar.

There Wingelot is harboured,

While Eärendel looks afar

O'er the darkness of the waters 30

Between here and Eglamar -

Out, out, beyond Taniquetil

In Valinor afar.

There are some interesting connections between this poem and the tale of <I>The Coming of the Elves and the Making of Kôr. </I>The ‘lonely hill’ of line 2 is the hill of Kôr (cf. the tale, I. 122: ‘at the head of this long creek there stands a lonely hill which gazes at the loftier mountains'), while ‘the golden feet of Kôr’ (a line replaced in the later versions of the poem) and very probably ‘the sand That stretches on for ever’ are explained by the passage that follows in the tale:

Thither [i.e. to Kôr] did Aulë bring all the dust of magic metals that his great works had made and gathered, and he piled it about the foot of that hill, and most of this dust was of gold, and a sand of gold stretched away from the feet of Kôr out into the distance where the Two Trees blossomed.
