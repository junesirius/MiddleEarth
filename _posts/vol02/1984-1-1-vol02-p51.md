it is said (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p119">1.119</a>) that Aryador was the name of Hisilómë among Men; for <I>Dor Lómin - Hisilómë</I> see <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p112">1.112</a>. At subsequent occurrences in this tale <I>Aryador</I> was not changed.
</p>

<I>Angband</I> was originally twice written, and in one of these cases it was changed to <I>Angamandi</I>, in the other ([p. 35]({{site.baseurl}}/vol02-p35)) allowed to stand; in all other instances <I>Angamandi</I> was the form first written. In the manuscript version of the tale Vëannë does not make consistent use of Gnomish or ‘Elvish’ forms: thus she says <I>Tevildo</I> (not <I>Tifil), Angamandi, Gwendeling (< Wendelin), Tinwelint (< Tinto (Ellu)</I>). In the typescript version, on the other hand, Vëannë says <I>Tiberth, Angband, Melian</I> (< <I>Gwenethlin), Thingol</I> (< <I>Tinwelint</I>).

<I>Hirilorn, the Queen of Trees < Golosbrindi, the Queen of the Forest</I> ([p. 18]({{site.baseurl}}/vol02-p18)); <I>Hirilorn < Golosbrindi</I> at subsequent occurrences.

<I>Uinen < Onen</I> (or possibly <I>Únen</I>).

<I>Egnor bo-Rimion < Egnor go-Rimion.</I> In the tales previously given the patronymic prefix is go- ([1.146]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p146), [155]({{site.baseurl}}/vol01-p155)).

<I>Tinwelint < Tinthellon</I> ([p. 35]({{site.baseurl}}/vol02-p35), the only case). Cf. <I>Tinto'ellon</I> mentioned above under <I>Tinwë Linto</I>.

<I>i-Cuilwarthon < i-Guilwarthon</I>.

(ii) Typescript Version

<I>Tinúviel < Tynwfiel</I> in the title and at every occurrence until the passage corresponding to MS version [p. 11]({{site.baseurl}}/vol02-p11) ‘yet now did he see Tinúviel dancing in the twilight’; there and subsequently the form typed was <I>Tinúviel</I>.

<I>Singoldo < Tinwë Linto</I> ([p. 41]({{site.baseurl}}/vol02-p41)).

<I>Melian < Gwenethlin</I> at every occurrence until the passage corresponding to MS version [p. 12]({{site.baseurl}}/vol02-p12) ‘the stateliness of Queen Gwendeling’; there and subsequently the form typed was <I>Melian.</I>

<I>Thingol < Tinwelint</I> at every occurrence until the passage corresponding to MS version [p. 12]({{site.baseurl}}/vol02-p12) ‘by winding paths to the abode of Tinwelint’; there and subsequently the form typed was <I>Thingol</I>.

For <I>Egnor > Barahir</I> see [p. 43]({{site.baseurl}}/vol02-p43).

Commentary on <I>The Tale of Tinúviel</I>

§ 1. <I>The primary narrative</I>

In this section I shall consider only the conduct of the main story, and leave for the moment such questions as the wider history implied in it, Tinwelint's people and his dwelling, or the geography of the lands that appear in the story.
