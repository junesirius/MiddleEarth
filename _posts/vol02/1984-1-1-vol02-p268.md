<p style="text-indent: 0;">
He threaded his path o'er the aftermath
</p>

Of the splendour of the Sun,<BR>And wandered far past many a star

In his gleaming galleon. 12<BR>On the gathering tide of darkness ride

The argosies of the sky,<BR>And spangle the night with their sails of light

As the streaming star goes by. 16

Unheeding he dips past these twinkling ships,

By his wayward spirit whirled<BR>On an endless quest through the darkling West

O'er the margin of the world; 20<BR>And he fares in haste o'er the jewelled waste

And the dusk from whence he came<BR>With his heart afire with bright desire

And his face in silver flame. 24

The Ship of the Moon from the East comes soon

From the Haven of the Sun,<BR>Whose white gates gleam in the coming beam

Of the mighty silver one. 28<BR>Lo! with bellying clouds as his vessel's shrouds

He weighs anchor down the dark,<BR>And on shimmering oars leaves the blazing shores

In his argent-timbered bark. 32
