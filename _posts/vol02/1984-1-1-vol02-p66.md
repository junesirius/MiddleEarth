<p style="text-indent: 0;">
Hisilómë, and <I>then</I> ‘Beren son of Egnor wandered out of Dor Lómin into Artanor . . .’ (In <I>The Silmarillion</I> the deeds of Beren and Lúthien preceded the Battle of Unnumbered Tears.)
</p>

Now in the <I>Tale of Tinúviel</I> there is a reference, in both versions, to the ‘thrall-Noldoli’ who laboured in Hisilómë and of Men dwelling there; and as the passage introducing Beren was first written in the manuscript his father was one of these slaves. It is said, again in both versions, that neither Tinwelint nor the most part of his people went to the battle, but that his lordship was greatly increased by fugitives from it (p. 9<I></I>); and to the following statement that his dwelling was hidden by the magic of Gwendeling/Melian the typescript adds the word ‘thereafter’ (p. 43), i.e. after the Battle of Unnumbered Tears. In the changed passage in the typescript referring to Egnor he is one of the chiefest foes of Melko ‘in all the kin of the Gnomes <I>that still were free’</I>.

All this seems to allow of only one conclusion: the events of the <I>Tale of Tinúviel</I> took place <I>after</I> the great battle; and this seems to be clinched by the express statement in the typescript: where the manuscript (p. 15) says that Melko ‘sought ever to destroy the friendship and intercourse of Elves and Men’, the second version adds (p. 44): <I>‘lest they forget the Battle of Unnumbered Tears</I> and once more arise in wrath against him’.

It is very odd, therefore, that Vëannë should say at the beginning (in the manuscript only, p. 10 and see p. 43) that she will tell ‘of things that happened in the halls of Tinwelint <I>after the arising of the Sun indeed but long ere the unforgotten Battle of Unnumbered Tears'</I>. (This in any case seems to imply a much longer period between the two events than is suggested in the outlines for <I>Gilfanon's Tale</I>: see 1.242). This is repeated later (p. 17): ‘it was a thing unthought . . . that any Elf ... should fare untended to the halls of Melko, <I>even in those earlier days before the Battle of Tears</I> when Melko's power had not grown great . . .’ But it is stranger still that this second sentence is retained in the typescript (p. 45). The typescript version has thus two inescapably contradictory statements:

Melko ‘sought ever to destroy the friendship and intercourse of Elves and Men, lest they forget the Battle of Unnumbered Tears' (p. 44);

‘Little love was there between the woodland Elves and the folk of Angband even in those days before the Battle of Unnumbered Tears'

(p. 45).

Such a radical contradiction within a single text is in the highest degree unusual, perhaps unique, in all the writings concerned with the First Age. But I can see no way to explain it, other than simply accepting it as a radical contradiction; nor indeed can I explain those statements in both versions that the events of the tale took place <I>before</I> the battle, since virtually all indications point to the contrary.\*
