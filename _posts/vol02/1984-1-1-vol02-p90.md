Then did some open to his knocking and Turambar strode into that hall, and Brodda bade him be seated and ordered wine and meats to be set before him, but Turambar would neither eat nor drink, so that men looking askance upon his sullenness asked him who he might be. Then Turambar stepping out into the midst of them before the high place where Brodda sat said: “Behold, I am Turambar son of the forest”, and men laughed thereat, but Turambar's eyes were full of wrath. Then said Brodda in doubt: “What wilt thou of me, O son of the wild forest?” But Turambar said: “Lord Brodda, I am come to repay thy stewardship of others' goods,” and silence fell in that place; but Brodda laughed, saying again: “But who art thou?” And thereupon Turambar leapt upon the high place and ere Brodda might foresee the act he drew Gurtholfin and seizing Brodda by the locks all but smote his head from off his body, crying aloud: “So dieth the rich man who addeth the widow's little to his much.

Yet now I fear that this man must get him swiftly from among us nor ever set foot upon these lands again, else shall any man slay him; but those lands and goods that were Úrin's shall Brodda's kin hold, save only
