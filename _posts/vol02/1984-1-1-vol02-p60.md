Yet said Mandos to those twain: ‘Lo, O Elves, it is not to any life of perfect joy that I dismiss you, for such may no longer be found in all the world where sits Melko of the evil heart - and know ye that ye <I>will become mortal even as Men, </I>and when ye fare hither again it will be for ever, unless the Gods summon you indeed to Valinor.’
</p>

In the tale of <I>The Coming of the Valar and the Building of Valinor </I>there occurs the following passage (1.76; commentary 1.90):

Thither [i.e. to Mandos] in after days fared the Elves of all the clans who were by illhap slain with weapons or did die of grief for those that were slain - and only so might the Eldar die, and then it was only for a while. There Mandos spake their doom, and there they waited in the darkness, dreaming of their past deeds, until such time as he appointed when they might again be born into their children, and go forth to laugh and sing again.

The same idea occurs in the tale of <I>The Music of the Ainur </I>(1.59). The peculiar dispensation of Mandos in the case of Beren and Tinúviel as here conceived is therefore that their whole ‘natural’ destiny as Elves was changed: having died as Elves might die (from wounds or from grief) they were not reborn as new beings, but returned from Mandos in their own persons - yet now ‘mortal even as Men’. The earliest eschatology is too unclear to allow of a satisfactory interpretation of this ‘mortality’, and the -passage in <I>The Building of Valinor </I>on the fates of Men (1.77) is particularly hard to understand (see the commentary on it, I.90ff.). But it seems possible that the words ‘even as Men’ in the address of Mandos to Beren and Tinúviel were included to stress the finality of whatever second deaths they might undergo; their departure would be as final as that of Men, there would be no second return in their own persons, and no reincarnation. They will remain in Mandos (‘when ye fare hither again it will be for ever’) - unless they are summoned by the Gods to dwell in Valinor. These last words should probably be related to the passage in <I>The Building of Valinor </I>concerning the fate of certain Men (1-77):

Few are they and happy indeed for whom at a season doth Nornorë the herald of the Gods set out. Then ride they with him in chariots or upon good horses down into the vale of Valinor and feast in the halls of Valmar, dwelling in the houses of the Gods until the Great End come.

To consider first what can be learned of the geography of the Great<BR>Lands from this tale: the early ‘dictionary’ of the Gnomish language
