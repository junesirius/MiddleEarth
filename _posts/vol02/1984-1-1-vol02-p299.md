<p style="text-indent: 0;">
There sleep came easy for the drone of bees<BR>Thronging about cottage gardens heaped with flowers;<BR>In love of sunlit goodliness of days<BR>There richly flowed their lives in settled hours -<BR>But that was long ago,
</p>

And now no more they sing, nor reap, nor sow;

And I perforce in many a town about this isle

Unsettled wanderer have dwelt awhile.

Wars of great kings and clash of armouries,<BR>Whose swords no man could tell, whose spears<BR>Were numerous as a wheatfield's ears,<BR>Rolled over all the Great Lands; and the Seas

Were loud with navies; their devouring fires<BR>Behind the armies burned both fields and towns;<BR>And sacked and crumbled or to flaming pyres<BR>Were cities made, where treasuries and crowns,

Kings and their folk, their wives and tender maids<BR>Were all consumed. Now silent are those courts,<BR>Ruined the towers, whose old shape slowly fades,<BR>And no feet pass beneath their broken ports.

There fell my father on a field of blood,<BR>And in a hungry siege my mother died,<BR>And I, a captive, heard the great seas' flood<BR>Calling and calling, that my spirit cried

For the dark western shores whence long ago had come<BR>Sires of my mother, and I broke my bonds,<BR>Faring o'er wasted valleys and dead lands<BR>Until my feet were moistened by the western sea,<BR>Until my ears were deafened by the hum,<BR>The splash, and roaring of the western sea -<BR>But that was long ago

And now the dark bays and unknown waves I know,

The twilight capes, the misty archipelago,

And all the perilous sounds and salt wastes 'tween this isle

Of magic and the coasts I knew awhile.
