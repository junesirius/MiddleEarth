<p style="text-indent: 0;">
With the ‘dragonheaded door’ (line 20) cf. the description of the Door of<BR>Night in <I>The Hiding of Valinor</I> (I.215-16):
</p>

Its pillars are of the mightiest basalt and its lintel likewise, but great dragons of black stone are carved thereon, and shadowy smoke pours slowly from their jaws.

In that description the Door of Night is not however ‘the gateway of the Moon’, for it is the Sun that passes through it into the outer dark, whereas ‘the Moon dares not the utter loneliness of the outer dark by reason of his lesser light and majesty, and he journeys still beneath the world [i.e. through the waters of Vai]’.

IV

<I>The Happy Mariners</I>

I give lastly this poem whose subject is the Tower of Pearl in the Twilit Isles. It was written in July 1915,<SUP>12</SUP> and there are six texts preceding the version which was published (together with ‘Why the Man in the Moon came down too soon’) at Leeds in 1923\* and which is the first of the two given here.

I know a window in a western tower

That opens on celestial seas,

And wind that has been blowing round the stars

Comes to nestle in its tossing draperies.

It is a white tower builded in the Twilight Isles, 5

Where Evening sits for ever in the shade;

It glimmers like a spike of lonely pearl

That mirrors beams forlorn and lights that fade;

And sea goes washing round the dark rock where it stands,

And fairy boats go by to gloaming lands 10

All piled and twinkling in the gloom

With hoarded sparks of orient fire
