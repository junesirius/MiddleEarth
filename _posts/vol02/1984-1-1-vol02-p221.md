<p style="text-indent: 0;">
We come now to the last of the original <I>Lost Tales</I> to be given consecutive narrative form. This is contained in a separate notebook, and it bears the title <I>The Nauglafring: The Necklace of the Dwarves</I>.
</p>

The beginning of this tale is somewhat puzzling. Before the telling of <I>The Fall of Gondolin</I> Lindo told Littleheart that ‘it is the desire of all that you tell us the tales of Tuor and of Eärendel as soon as may be’ (p. 144), and Littleheart replied: ‘It is a mighty tale, and seven times shall folk fare to the Tale-fire ere it be rightly told; and so twined is it with those stories of the Nauglafring and of the Elf-march that I would fain have aid in that telling of Ailios here . . .’ Thus Littleheart's surrender of the chair of the tale-teller to Ailios at the beginning of the present text, so that Ailios should tell of the Nauglafring, fits the general context well; but we should not expect the new tale to be introduced with the words ‘But after a while silence fell’, since <I>The Fall of Gondolin</I> ends ‘And no one in all the Room of Logs spake or moved for a great while.’ In any case, after the very long <I>Fall of Gondolin</I> the next tale would surely have waited till the following evening.

This tale is once again a manuscript in ink over a wholly erased original in pencil, but only so far as the words ‘sate his greed’ on page 230. From this point to the end there is only a primary manuscript in pencil in the first stage of composition, written in haste - in places hurled on to the page, with a good many words not certainly decipherable; and a part of this was extensively rewritten while the tale was still in progress (see note 13).

<I>The Nauglafring<BR>The Necklace of the Dwarves</I>

But after a while silence fell, and folk murmured ‘Eärendel’, but others said ‘Nay - what of the Nauglafring, the Necklace of the Dwarves.’ Therefore said Ilfiniol, leaving the chair of the taleteller: ‘Yea, better would the tale be told if Ailios would relate the matters concerning that necklace,’ and Ailios being nowise unwilling thus began, looking upon the company.
